We investigate measurement-induced localization in a continuously monitored one-dimensional Aubry--André--Harper model, focusing on the quantum Zeno regime in which the measurements dominate coherent dynamics. The presence of a quasiperiodic potential renders the problem analytically tractable and enables a controlled study of the interplay between monitoring and disorder. We develop an analytical description based on an instantaneous Schrödinger equation with a measurement-induced effective potential constructed self-consistently from individual quantum trajectories, without relying on postselection. In the quantum Zeno regime, an emergent dominant energy scale reduces the problem to a transfer-matrix formulation of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which allows direct computation of the Lyapunov exponent. Complementarily, we extract the localization length numerically from long-time steady-state quantum state diffusion trajectories by reconstructing the intrinsic localized single-particle wave functions and analyzing their spatial decay. These numerical results show quantitative agreement with the effective theory predictions, with controlled corrections of order $J^2/[λ^2+(γ/2)^2]$ (where $J$ is the hopping amplitude, $γ$ the measurement strength, and $λ$ the quasiperiodic potential). Our results underscore the connection between the effective non-Hermitian description and the stochastic monitored dynamics, showing the interplay between Zeno-like localization, coherent hopping, and quasiperiodic-disorder-induced localization, while also laying the groundwork for understanding and exploiting measurement-induced localization as a tool for quantum control and state preparation.

- **TL;DR**: 在规则晶格耦合振荡器网络中，通过拓扑数据分析发现协调数约7时出现同步起始动力学交叉：低协调数晶格表现出延迟相干和表面限制传播，而高协调数晶格显示快速特征碎片化和指数加速同步起始。

The transition to global synchronization in coupled dynamical systems is governed by the interplay between coupling strength and structural topology. Although abrupt, first-order-like synchronization transitions have been extensively reported in heterogeneous networks, it is unclear whether comparable accelerated onset behavior can emerge purely from coordination geometry in spatially homogeneous, regular lattices. In this study, we investigate large-scale ($N=10^5$) stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillator networks defined on regular lattices with controlled coordination number. Using topological data analysis (TDA), simplicial-complex characterization, and optimal-transport-based geometric diagnostics, we identify a coordination-controlled crossover in synchronization onset dynamics at approximately $z_{c} \approx 7$ within the class of regular lattices considered. Low-coordination lattices ($z &lt; z_{c}$) exhibit persistent $H_2$ topological features in the dynamical amplitude field that correlate with delayed coherence and surface-limited propagation. In contrast, higher-coordination lattices ($z &gt; z_{c}$) display rapid fragmentation of these features, reduced interface roughness, and predominantly positive Ricci curvature. This is consistent with enhanced path redundancy and improved transport efficiency. In this regime, the global order parameter exhibits accelerated exponential-like growth during the onset stage. Throughout this work, abrupt synchronization refers specifically to this exponential onset behavior rather than to thermodynamic first-order hysteresis. Our results demonstrate that increasing coordination density induces a qualitative reorganization of higher-order topological structure that strongly correlates with synchronization efficiency in regular lattice systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了矩阵加权网络上的图灵模式形成，通过引入节点相关的正交矩阵表示，将矩阵加权扩散简化为标量加权网络扩散，并扩展了经典图灵不稳定性分析。

Diffusion-driven instability is a fundamental mechanism underlying pattern formation in spatially extended systems. In almost all existing works, diffusion across the links of the underlying network is modeled through scalar weights, possibly complemented by cross-diffusion terms that are homogeneous across links. In this work, we investigate the emergence of Turing patterns on Matrix Weighted Networks (MWNs), a recently introduced framework in which each edge is associated with a matrix weight. Focusing on the class of coherent MWNs, we provide a novel characterization of coherence in terms of node-dependent orthonormal matrices, showing that link transformations can be written as relative rotations between nodes. This representation allows us to deal with coherent MWNs of any size and to introduce an orthonormal change of variables capable to reduce diffusion on a coherent MWN to diffusion on a standard weighted network with scalar weights. Building on this, we extend the classical Turing instability analysis to MWNs and derive the conditions under which a homogeneous equilibrium of the local dynamics loses stability due to matrix-weighted diffusion. Our results show how network topology, scalar weights, and inter-node transformations jointly shape pattern formation, and provide a constructive framework to analyze and design Turing patterns on matrix-weighted and higher-order networked systems.

- **TL;DR**: 研究自推进粒子在热噪声和恒定流中保持定位的最优控制，发现精度与能耗之间存在权衡关系，超过特定精度阈值需要主动驱动，最优协议包含不连续的游动速度和扩散系数切换。

How much work does it cost for a propelled particle to stay localised near a stationary target, defying both thermal noise and a constant flow that would carry it away? We study the control of such a particle in finite time and find optimal protocols for time-dependent swim velocity and diffusivity, without feedback. Accuracy, quantified via the mean squared deviation from the target, and energetic cost turn out to be related by a trade-off, which complements the one between precision and cost known in stochastic thermodynamics. We show that accuracy better than a certain threshold requires active driving, which comes at a cost that increases with accuracy. The optimal protocols have discontinuous swim velocity and diffusivity, switching between a passive drift state with vanishing diffusivity and an active propulsion state. This study highlights how a time-dependent diffusivity enhances optimal control and sets benchmarks for cost and accuracy of artificial self-propelled particles navigating noisy environments.

### Time Reversal Symmetry Breaking and {\it Fragile Magnetic Superconductors}

- **TL;DR**: 论文综述了约20个在低温超导体中观测到时间反演对称性破缺的报告，这些发现主要基于μSR数据，检测到的磁场强度相似且接近检测下限，对应磁化强度不超过10^-3 μB/原子。作者将这些材料归类为"脆弱磁性超导体"，并质疑μSR测量过程本身可能影响结果，同时讨论了LaNiGa₂作为案例研究。

Roughly twenty reports (as of 2025) of time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) states in low critical temperature (T$_c$) superconducting (SC), otherwise conventional Fermi liquid, metals have emerged primarily from muon spin relaxation ($μ$SR) data. The detected fields, inferred from the current interpretation of depolarization data, are similar in magnitude and not far above the lower limit of detection, corresponding to magnetizations of no more than 10$^{-3}$ $μ_B$/atom. These materials comprise a new class of {\it fragile magnetic superconductors} modeled as triplet pairing. The measured SC state properties, excepting only the fields detected below T$_c$, are representative of low T$_c$ singlet BCS SCs, not showing unusual coherence lengths or critical fields. While it is recognized that the muon does affect the sample by displacing nearby atoms and impacting magnetic interaction parameters, the measurement process, changing the system from sample $\rightarrow$ sample+$μ^+$ thereby breaking TRS, may deserve further scrutiny. This overview provides a survey of the environment of the muon, from the normal state to the superfluid state, where the induced supercurrent and Yu-Shiba-Rusinov gap states provide coupling of the muon moment to the superfluid. The unusual topological superconductor LaNiGa$_2$, currently modeled as non-unitary triplet, is used as a case study. Supposing that the prevailing $μ$SR inference of a small spontaneous field within the bulk of theSC obtains, the current picture of (possibly non-unitary) triplet pairing is discussed and an attractive alternative for LaNiGa$_2$ is noted.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种适用于任意截面管道中不可混溶两层气液分层流动的新模型，包含不可压缩液体层和可压缩气体层，分析了模型的超双曲特性并进行了数值验证。

In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.

We report the results of magnetotransport experiments carried out on low-disorder 2D hole gases (2DHG) in the strongly correlated liquid regime, hosted in dopant-free (100) GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunctions. Over a wide range of 2DHG densities (from 0.7 $\times$ 10$^{15}$/m$^2$ to $2 \times 10^{15}$/m$^2$), Fourier analysis of low-field (B &lt; 1 T) Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals two spin-orbit-split heavy-hole (HH) subbands with distinct effective masses contributing to transport. Surprisingly, the lighter-mass HH subband exhibits a parabolic dispersion with Fermi wavevector below the anticrossing between the heavy-hole and light-hole subbands, while the heavier HH subband is non-parabolic throughout. Quantitative comparison with numerical calculations based on the Luttinger model reveals that both effective masses are enhanced by a common factor ($\approx$ 2.3), which we attribute to many-body interactions. This common scaling factor has a very weak dependence on the 2DHG density, likely due to band hybridization. Our measured hole masses are compared with published cyclotron resonance and magnetotransport values. We propose a cohesive framework reconciling the long-standing three-way discrepancy between Luttinger theory, magnetotransport, and cyclotron resonance measurements of density-dependent effective masses in partially spin-orbit-polarized heavy-hole systems in GaAs.

We propose and investigate a novel two-dimensional (2D) tight-binding model defined on a diamond-dodecagon lattice geometry that hosts multiple flat bands (FBs) and supports topological phase transitions driven by a magnetic flux. This lattice exhibits three completely flat, non-dispersive bands in the band structure in the absence of magnetic flux due to destructive interference in the electron hoppings, leading to the emergence of compact localized states (CLS). These CLS are analytically constructed and exhibit real-space confinement of the electrons, arising solely due to the lattice's geometrical frustration. It has been shown that these FBs are very robust against the introduction of weak random onsite disorder in the system. By tuning the uniform magnetic flux threaded through the diamond plaquettes, we demonstrate a tunable evolution of the band structure and show that certain bands develop nontrivial topological features with nonzero integer values of the Chern number. Additionally, we have computed the multi-terminal transport properties for this 2D lattice system, which display the flux-tunable resonances and transmission suppression linked to the FBs, establishing a clear interplay between the localization, topology, and transport. Our findings put forward the diamond-dodecagon lattice as a robust and tunable platform for studying the flat-band physics and magnetic flux-controlled topological phenomena, offering promising experimental feasibility in photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems.

### Consistent inclusion of triple substitutions within a coupled cluster based static quantum embedding theory

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种将CCSDT求解器整合到MPCC静态嵌入框架中的方法，通过引入环境三激发振幅的微扰处理，开发了MPCCSDT(pt)和MPCCSDT(it)两种方法，显著提升了CCSD(T)的精度。

We incorporate a solver for the fragment problem with accuracy beyond coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) into the previously proposed static embedding framework, MPCC. To this end, we employ a CCSDT solver for the fragment subsystem. For the environment subsystem, we construct a perturbative estimate of the triples amplitudes, explicitly accounting for feedback from all fragment amplitudes. The resulting approach is denoted MPCCSDT(pt). We further introduce a more complete formulation in which feedback from the environment amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes is also included. This scheme involves an iterative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes and is denoted MPCCSDT(it). In addition, we assess the accuracy of the previously proposed low-level method by introducing a modified low-level approach that incorporates a lowest-order treatment of selected long-range effects, including spin fluctuations and charge polarization. All resulting approaches may be viewed as post-CCSD(T) methods. We therefore consider test cases for which CCSD(T) exhibits substantial deviations from CCSDT. Our results demonstrate that inclusion of triples amplitudes at the fragment level alone is insufficient; a perturbative treatment of the environment triples amplitudes is required. For many energy-difference applications, feedback from the environment triples amplitudes to the fragment amplitudes, is not essential, but it does play a role in the very challenging molecules. A very interesting finding from our study is that in some challenging cases, we need an improved (second-order) perturbative method for the SD amplitudes, going beyond the first-order one used in our earlier work.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于神经网络的偏置势能重要性采样方法，加速MCMC模拟中的稀有事件采样，并通过分支随机游走提高效率。

Atomistic simulations provide valuable insights into the physical processes governing material behavior. However, their applicability is fundamentally constrained by the limited time scales accessible to brute-force simulations. This bottleneck often stems from complex energy landscapes where the systems stay trapped in metastable states for long periods of time. Yet, the long-term evolution is controlled by the transitions between the metastable states, which are rare events and difficult to observe. We present an importance sampling method designed to accelerate the time scale of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. By employing a bias potential, our approach enhances the sampling of rare transition events while preserving the relative probabilities of distinct transition pathways. The bias potential is represented by a neural network which enables the flexibility needed for high-dimensional systems. We propose a rigorous formulation to obtain the original transition rates between metastable states using transition paths obtained from the biased simulation. We further use a branching random walk (BRW) technique to enhance efficiency and to reduce variance. The proposed methodology is validated on 2-dimensional and 14-dimensional systems, demonstrating its accuracy and scalability.

### Introduction to High-Temperature Superconductivity for Solid State Chemists

Superconductivity is one of the most amazing properties that metallic conductors exhibit. Electrical resistance is completely eliminated below the critical temperature (Tc), which is the most important parameter in superconductivity. Since the discovery of copper oxide superconductors 39 years ago, many solid state chemists have made significant contributions to the field by discovering new compounds and producing high-quality samples for physical measurements. However, superconductivity research remains challenging for most solid state chemists because it requires knowledge of complicated solid state physics. This manuscript aims to provide a simple, intuitive introduction to superconductivity using only fundamental physics concepts that solid state chemists are familiar with. The author investigates a wide range of materials and classifies them according to the superconductivity mechanisms that may drive them. Specifically focusing on a series of copper oxide superconductors with the highest Tc at ambient conditions, the remarkable material dependence of Tc and the underlying, unconventional superconductivity mechanism that leads to the high Tc are thoroughly examined. Although our understanding of cuprate superconductivity is still fragmented, the author believes that once the branches and leaves are removed, the story will be fairly simple, similar to the phonon-based superconductivity mechanism revealed by the BCS theory. Furthermore, potential strategies for raising the Tc of cuprates and other superconductors are discussed. The author hopes that this article will pique interest in superconductors in young solid state chemists and encourage them to pursue the discovery of still unknown and unexplored room-temperature superconductors in the future.

We theoretically study the effects of magnonic Kerr nonlinearity on magnon-polaritons (MPs) with a soft-mode in easy-axis ferromagnets coupled to a microwave cavity. Using an effective circuit model capable of describing MPs up to the nonperturbative strong-coupling regime, we show that chaotic and frequency-comb-like behaviors of MPs emerge at the original modes crossing point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity induces a finite excitation gap in the soft-mode, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.

We report a $k$-point extension of the second-order co-iterative augmented Hessian (CIAH) algorithm, termed $k$-CIAH, for Pipek-Mezey (PM) localization of Wannier functions (WFs). By exploiting an efficient evaluation of the Hessian-vector product, $k$-CIAH achieves $O(N_k^2 n^3)$ scaling in both CPU time and memory, matching that of previously reported first-order $k$-space approaches while improving upon the $O(N_k^3 n^3)$ scaling of $Γ$-point CIAH, where $N_k$ denotes the number of $k$-points sampling the first Brillouin zone and $n$ characterizes the unit-cell size. Benchmark calculations on a diverse set of solids -- including insulators, semiconductors, metals, and surfaces -- demonstrate the fast and robust convergence of $k$-CIAH-based PMWF optimization, which yields an overall computational efficiency approximately 2-3 -fold higher than first-order $k$-space methods and orders of magnitude higher than $Γ$-point CIAH for localizing 1000-5000 orbitals. The quality of the resulting PMWFs is further validated by accurate electronic band structures obtained via PMWF-based Wannier interpolation.

- **TL;DR**: 信息晶格作为观测无关的工具，可用于分析一维紧束缚链中金属-绝缘体转变，发现金属在低温下信息按幂律分布，而高温或绝缘体则呈指数衰减。

Correlation functions and correlation lengths are frequently used to describe phase transitions in quantum systems, but they require an explicit choice of observables. The recently introduced information lattice instead provides an observable-independent way to identify where and at which scale information is contained in quantum lattice models. Here, we use it to study the difference between the metallic and insulating regime of one-dimensional tight-binding chains. We find that the information per scale follows a power law in metals at low temperature and that Friedel-like oscillations are visible in the information lattice. At high temperature or in insulators at low temperature, the information per scale decays exponentially. Thus, the information lattice is a useful tool for analyzing the metal-insulator transition.

The discovery of critical points that can host quantized nonlocal order parameters and degenerate edge modes relocate the study of symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) to gapless regions. In this letter, we reveal gapless SPTs (gSPTs) in systems tuned out-of-equilibrium by periodic drivings and non-Hermitian couplings. Focusing on one-dimensional models with sublattice symmetry, we introduce winding numbers by applying the Cauchy's argument principle to generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ), yielding unified topological characterizations and bulk-edge correspondence in both gapped phases and at gapless critical points. The theory is demonstrated in a broad class of Floquet bipartite lattices, unveiling unique topological criticality of non-Hermitian Floquet origin. Our findings identify gSPTs in driven open systems and uncover robust topological edge modes at phase transitions beyond equilibrium.

We investigate thermal and non-local electrical transport in four-terminal Josephson junctions formed by a normal region coupled to two transverse chiral superconducting leads, supporting phases characterized by Chern numbers ${\cal C}=0,\,1$\,and\,2. We identify the conditions under which a single chiral Majorana mode (${\cal C}=1$) produces a robust half-quantized thermal conductance, while non-local electrical conductance remains strongly suppressed by particle-hole symmetry. Thermal conductance quantization occurs near a superconducting phase difference $π$, but only in the low-doping regime of the central region and in the intermediate- to long-junction limits. At finite Zeeman fields, the thermal response broadly follows the topology of the isolated superconducting leads for the $C=1$ phase while, in the ${\cal C}=2$ phase, the thermal conductance generally deviates from quantization, depending on the momentum-space location of the Majorana modes. Our results establish clear criteria for probing chiral Majorana modes in Josephson junctions and highlight the essential role of momentum-space structure, finite-size geometry, and sample parameters in thermal transport.

Employing both electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics (ED-MD) simulations for atomistic models and the dynamic instability theory of electrocapillary wave, we investigate the structure evolutions and thermal runaway process of Cu, Ti and W nanotips with radii of curvature of 1 nm and 5 nm under various radiofrequency electric field conditions. The associated critical parameters including the critical electric field, spatial and temporal scales of the electrohydrodynamic instability of molten apexes are obtained by proposing the workflows that utilize the atomistic models in ED-MD simulations to calculate kinematic viscosity tensor components and mass density spatial distributions for the nanomelts with electric fields. Our current ED-MD simulations for nanotips show a non-monotonical variation of the time delay versus the electric field frequency for metal nanotips, and the presence of a critical rf electric field amplitude triggering the thermal runaway regardless of the field frequency. The calculated mass densities and kinematic viscosities of nanomelts for metal nanotips are found to be drastically different to those of bulk liquid metals at the melting point. Specifically, the viscosity of nanomelt under the rf electric field is revealed to be several orders of magnitude higher than the bulk liquid metal, resulting in substantial increase of spatial and temporal scales in the instability theory of electrocapillary wave within the viscosity-dominated regime, compared to the results of ED-MD simulations for Cu and Ti metals, while good agreement between the two methods on the critical wavelength and time delay of thermal runway is found for W nanotips.

We present a theoretical study of the nonlinear magneto-optical shift conductivity in the surface states of the prototypical topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ under a perpendicular quantizing magnetic field. By describing the electronic states as Landau levels and using a perturbative approach, we derive the microscopic expression for the shift conductivity $σ^{(2);αβγ}(-ω,ω)$, where $α,β,γ=\pm$ stand for the circular polarization of light and $ω$ is the light frequency; the spectra are further decomposed into contributions from the interband and intraband optical transitions, for which the selection rules are identified. Considering that the system possesses $C_3$ point group of symmetry, the nonzero components of the conductivity tensor are $σ^{(2);-++}=[σ^{(2);+--}]^\ast$. Therefore, a pure circularly polarized light generates zero shift current. In the clean limit, the conductivities are nonzero only for discrete photon energies because of the discrete Landau levels and energy conservation, and they become Lorentzian lineshapes with the inclusion of damping, which relaxes the condition of energy conservation. The dependence of the spectra on the damping parameters, the magnetic fields, and the chemical potentials is investigated in detail. Our results reveal that the shift current is highly tunable by the chemical potential and the magnetic field. These results underscore the potential of topological insulators for tunable, strong nonlinear magneto-optical applications.

We discuss electronic and magnetic properties of Na$_x$Fe$_{1/2}$Mn$_{1/2}$O$_2$, a promising Na-ion battery cathode material. Using x-ray Compton scattering, SQUID magnetometry, and density-functional-theory based modeling, we probe how electrons and spins evolve during sodiation. By comparing Compton profiles of sodiated and desodiated samples, we show that oxygen 2$p$ orbitals drive the redox process, while transition-metal 3$d$ electrons become more delocalized, explaining the metallic phase at $x=2/3$. These profile differences define a quantitative descriptor for the sodiation range associated with improved conductivity. Electron holes on oxygen, reflected in oxygen magnetization, confirm the important role of oxygen in the electrochemical activity of the cathode.

Quantum-chemical calculations often make use of point-group theory to exploit molecular symmetry, resulting in a reduction of the computational cost and in insights into the electronic structure. This exploitation is often limited to subgroups of $D_{2h}$ which are Abelian with real characters. Here, we extend the symmetry exploitation to Abelian point groups with complex characters. Such point groups are often encountered in calculations that involve finite magnetic fields, though their occurrence is not limited to these cases alone. We present the evaluation of integrals over symmetry-adapted orbitals using the double-coset decomposition, as well as the use of these symmetries in the contractions needed within post Hartree Fock calculations in the context of block tensors. Efficiency gains are discussed for four simple hydrocarbons that exhibit a complex Abelian point group in the presence of a magnetic field.

The recent discovery of robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) aligned with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has established a highly versatile platform for correlated topological matter. This review synthesizes the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these interaction-driven topological phases. Experimentally, the landscape has rapidly expanded from initial Chern insulators in trilayer systems to fully quantized QAH states in thicker systems. Theoretically, it is believed that moiré potential and electron-electron interaction cooperate and produce the QAH effect in such systems. Theoretical calculations also bring interesting questions, such as the formation of an interaction-driven topological phase known as an anomalous Hall crystal (AHC). This review comprehensively covers the experimental hallmarks, the theoretical frameworks, including continuum models and many-body approaches, and the ensuing physical picture that reconciles the roles of interactions, displacement fields, and the moiré potentials. We conclude by outlining outstanding open questions and future directions, positioning RMG/hBN systems at the forefront of topological quantum matter.

Identifying whether a many-body ground state is gapped or gapless is a fundamental yet challenging problem, especially in quantum spin liquids. In this work, we develop a gap-diagnostic scheme based on the polarization amplitude defined via a twist operator, evaluated within the infinite density-matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) framework. As a benchmark, analysis of the spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain demonstrates that the polarization amplitude clearly distinguishes the gapless Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid from the gapped Néel phase. We then extend this framework to infinite cylinders of the spin-$1/2$ XY-$J_χ$ model on the square lattice. We find that the polarization amplitude sharply detects the transition between the gapless XY phase and the gapped chiral spin liquid phase. These results show that polarization amplitudes provide a strong energy-gap diagnostic in two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets, including quantum spin liquids.

Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.

Advanced computational tools that describe the interaction of electrons with structured nanophotonic materials are crucial for theoretical predictions, specific design tasks, and the interpretation of experimental results. These tools open the door to systematic exploration of free-electron-driven nanophotonic light sources, among others. Here, we report on the implementation of electron-beam spectroscopy in a T-matrix-based scattering formulation. Such a framework is quite versatile in predicting the electromagnetic response of complex photonic materials composed of periodically or aperiodically arranged individual scatterers. By extending this formalism to describe interactions with fast electrons, we provide a fast and accurate numerical tool for simulating cathodoluminescence (CL) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements. The desired functionalities are implemented into the existing software suite treams for electromagnetic scattering computations, and the extended code treams_ebeam is available online at https://github.com/tfp-photonics/treams_ebeam. We demonstrate the implementation details on a carefully selected set of problems, including single scatterers of various shapes and materials, a periodic chain of elliptical nanodisks, and a finite cluster of nanospheres arranged in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. By uniting fast-electron physics with advanced scattering theory, our framework unlocks new possibilities for designing, understanding, and engineering next-generation nanoscale light-matter interactions.

We study crossed Andreev reflection occurring in quantum dots connected to one superconducting lead and two normal leads at low temperatures $T$. Specifically, we derive an exact formula for the conductance up to order $T^2$ in the large superconducting gap limit, which is expressed in terms of the transmission probabilities of Cooper pairs and interacting Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Our formulation is based on the latest version of Fermi-liquid theory for the Anderson impurity model, which has clarified the quasiparticle energy shifts of order $ω^2$ and $T^2$ -- that is, corrections of the same order as those arising from the finite lifetime of quasiparticles -- can be exactly taken into account through three-body correlations of impurity electrons. We also demonstrate how the three-body contributions evolve and affect the Cooper-pair tunneling as the Andreev level moves away from the Fermi level, using the numerical renormalization group approach. The results demonstrate that the Cooper-pair contribution to the $T^2$ term of the nonlocal conductance becomes comparable to the Bogoliubov-quasiparticle contribution in the parameter region where superconducting proximity effects dominate over the Kondo effect.

### Symmetries of Spin-Splitting Induced by Spin-Orbit Coupling in Non-magnetic Crystals

Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) leads to splitting of otherwise spin-degenerate bands in noncentrosymmetric materials, even if time-reversal symmetry is present. While this gives rise to well-known phenomena such as the Rashba and Dresselhaus effects, various other terms are allowed based on the point group of the crystal and the electronic Hamiltonian. In this study, we utilize point group representations to illustrate that four different types of SOC terms (Rashba, Dresselhaus, Weyl, and Ising) can emerge in periodic solids. We construct reciprocal space energy expressions for each type of SOC-induced splitting of opposite spin bands, and follow a similar procedure to also obtain minimal tight-binding models that capture all types of spin-splittings for subgroups of the cubic parent group $m\bar{3}m$. Furthermore, we also obtain a complete list of nodal features in the electronic band structure in these systems, distinguishing between crystallographic-symmetry-imposed nodal lines and those imposed by time-reversal-symmetry only. Finally, we conclude by presenting a list of materials that host each type of inversion-breaking SOC effects. Our classification of the spin-splitting symmetries in non-magnetic systems with SOC is the counterpart of the recent classification of spin-splitting symmetries in unconventional magnetic systems without SOC, such as altermagnets and odd-parity magnets. More broadly, our work provides a basis for studying superconductivity and other collective electronic phenomena that are impacted by SOC-induced band splittings in noncentrosymmetric materials.

- **TL;DR**: NQS-SC方法在电子结构计算中优于传统的NQS-VMC方法，特别是在静态相关分子中表现更好，但两者都无法有效捕捉动态相关，需要未来混合方法

Neural quantum states (NQS) provide a flexible and highly expressive parameterization of wave functions for strongly correlated problems in quantum chemistry. Despite rapid advances in network architectures, the evaluation of electronic energies remains almost exclusively based on variational Monte Carlo (VMC). While VMC is effective for structured systems such as spin chains, its accuracy and efficiency for electronic Hamiltonians are hindered by sharply peaked distributions, stochastic gradient noise, and slow convergence with sample size. In this letter, we assess the capability of NQS-VMC to efficiently capture correlation in electronic ground states by comparing it to a recently developed NQS-based selected configuration (NQS-SC) approach. We set up a systematic comparison of the ground-state optimizations obtained with NQS-VMC and NQS-SC for molecular systems dominated by either static or dynamical correlation. The comparison demonstrates a clear advantage of NQS-SC over NQS-VMC in both energy accuracy and wave-function coefficients, particularly for statically correlated molecules. Moreover, NQS-SC exhibits robust systematic improvability, whereas NQS-VMC does not. These findings position NQS-SC as the new default approach over NQS-VMC for electronic structure calculations. We further observe that neither NQS-SC nor NQS-VMC can efficiently capture dynamical correlation, highlighting the need for future hybrid methods, such as multiconfigurational perturbation theories built on top of NQS solutions.

The earlier theory [1] of the quantum phase transitions related to the change of the Fermi Surface Topology (FST) is advanced. For such transitions the Fermi surface as a quantum critical manifold determined by the Lee-Yang zeros, the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ as the $d$-volume of the Fermi sea, and the special FST universality class were introduced in [1]. The exactly solvable Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) $d$-dimensional ($d=1,2,3$) model of interacting fermions is analyzed. We explore the relation between the Lee-Yang zeros, the Luttinger and the plateau (Oshikawa) theorems. The validity of the Luttinger theorem in the HK model is confirmed. It is shown that the order parameter $\mathcal{P}$ and the FST universality class describe the transitions between metal and band/Mott insulators, as well as the Lifshitz and van Hove gapless-to-gapless transitions. The gapless phases are established to be the Landau Fermi liquids (metals). In addition to the conventional paradigm with a continuous order parameter, we apply the homology theory to analyze the FST transitions. They are critical points of the Morse function. To quantify FST we use the Euler characteristic, which is calculated for each phase of the HK model. We claim that the FST universality class is robust with respect to interactions and other model details, under the condition that the critical points are non-degenerate.

### Estimating Full Path Lengths and Kinetics from Partial Path Transition Interface Sampling Simulations

Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths.

Transitions between distinct dynamical regimes are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium systems. As a prototypical example, deposition growth is often accompanied by irreversible morphological instabilities. Forecasting such transitions from pre-transition configurations remains fundamentally challenging, as early precursors are weak, spatially heterogeneous, and masked by inherent fluctuations. Here, we investigate compact-to-dendritic transitions (CDTs) in a two-dimensional particle-based electrodeposition model and formulate a horizon-based early-warning task using trajectory-resolved transition points. We demonstrate that anticipating the CDT is intrinsically a spatiotemporal problem: neither static morphological descriptors nor temporal learning applied to predefined features alone yields reliable predictive signals. In contrast, end-to-end learning of jointly optimized spatial and temporal representations from growth images enables robust anticipation across a wide range of prediction horizons. Analysis of the learned latent dynamics reveals the emergence of a low-dimensional surrogate variable that tracks progressive morphological destabilization and undergoes reorganization near the transition. We further show that the learned spatiotemporal representation exhibits limited but systematic transferability across reaction-rate conditions, with predictive performance degrading as the inference condition departs from the training condition, consistent with changes in the latent-state dynamics. Overall, our results establish a general formulation for forecasting incipient instabilities in nonequilibrium interfacial growth, with implications for the predictive monitoring and control of pattern-forming driven systems.

We analyze the magnetization curve of the spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg model in a magnetic field. Using state-of-the-art variational wavefunctions based on neural networks, we confirm the presence of robust magnetization plateaus at $m=1/3$, $5/9$ and $7/9$ of the saturation value, stabilized by a spontaneous symmetry breaking of lattice translations with a $\sqrt{3}\times \sqrt{3}$ unit cell. Regarding the more challenging $m=1/9$ plateau, we find two competing valence bond crystals depending on the system size, both breaking translation as well as point group symmetries and with a larger $3\times 3$ unit cell. Such quantum states with local modulations of the magnetization average values could be observed experimentally in the near future.

We present a one-way shooting algorithm for transition path sampling that accepts every proposed trajectory yet samples the correct transition path ensemble for systems with overdamped stochastic dynamics. The method is based on two key elements: a procedure to propose trajectories that are always reactive, and a reweighting scheme that corrects for the bias introduced by always accepting the proposed paths. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of transition path sampling by eliminating the cost associated with generating trajectories that are then rejected. We demonstrate the algorithm by investigating the formation of CO$_2$ clathrate hydrates along different reaction mechanisms, showing that the increased efficiency allows proper sampling of the formation of crystalline hydrates at temperatures and pressures that are difficult to access with conventional algorithms.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种基于低秩张量网络的动理学等离子体模拟数值方法，通过自适应压缩的相空间分布函数表示，在压缩形式下直接进行谱变换和时间推进，无需重构完整相空间网格。

We propose a numerical method for kinetic plasma simulation in which the phase-space distribution function is represented by a low-rank tensor network with an adaptive level of compression. The Vlasov-Poisson system is advanced using Strang splitting, and each substep is treated spectrally in the corresponding variable. By expressing both the distribution function and the Fourier transform as tensor network objects (state and operator representations), spectral transforms are applied directly in compressed form, enabling time stepping without reconstructing the full phase-space grid. The self-consistent electric field is also computed within the tensor formalism. The charge density is obtained by contracting over velocity degrees of freedom and extracting the zero Fourier mode, which provides the source term for a spectral Poisson solver. We validate the approach on standard benchmarks, including Landau damping and the two-stream instability. Finally, we systematically study how compression parameters, including truncation tolerances and internal ranks (bond dimensions), affect momentum and energy conservation, positivity behavior, robustness to filamentation, and computational cost.

We theoretically investigate the plasmon modes of alternating-twist multilayer graphene. In multilayer systems, interlayer coupling gives rise to distinctive plasmon modes, but calculations in moiré systems remain challenging due to their complex tunneling structures. Using the Kac-Murdock-Szegő Toeplitz formalism, we derive that the in-phase mode exhibits the conventional $\sqrt{q}$ behavior, while the out-of-phase modes acquire plasmon gaps determined by specific interband transitions between Dirac cones with different velocities in the long-wavelength limit. We demonstrate that these out-of-phase modes remain undamped in the weak Coulomb-interaction limit when the twist angle exceeds a critical value ($θ\gtrsim 2.75^\circ$ for the alternating-twist trilayer case), regardless of the carrier density as long as the low-energy effective Dirac Hamiltonian remains valid. Furthermore, we consider the effect of a perpendicular electric field, and demonstrate how plasmon modes can be tuned by a gate voltage.

Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种在AFQMC框架中计算精确可扩展核力的方法，利用自动微分获得核梯度，并通过机器学习策略处理噪声数据，应用于几何优化和反应路径计算。

In this article, we present a method for computing accurate and scalable nuclear forces within the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) framework. Our approach leverages automatic differentiation of the energy functional to obtain nuclear gradients at a computational cost comparable to that of energy evaluation. The accuracy of the method is validated against finite difference calculations, showing excellent agreement. We then explore several machine learning (ML) strategies for learning noisy AFQMC data. These ML potentials are subsequently used to perform geometry optimizations and nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations, successfully identifying the transition state of the formamide-formimidic acid tautomerization. The resulting transition state geometry and barrier heights are in close agreement with coupled-cluster reference values. This work paves the way for highly accurate geometry optimization, molecular dynamics, or reaction path calculations.

- **TL;DR**: 多层二维电子系统的磁等离子体激元研究框架：使用KMS Toeplitz矩阵考虑层间库仑相互作用，分析无层间隧穿时的模式分裂和有隧穿时的色散关系。

We provide a systematic framework to investigate the magnetoplasmons of multilayer two-dimensional electron systems by using the Kac--Murdock--Szegő (KMS) Toeplitz matrix to consider interlayer Coulomb interactions. In the absence of interlayer tunneling, we show that the single-layer magnetoplasmon branch splits into $N$ collective modes -- one in-phase mode and $N-1$ out-of-phase modes -- and derive their asymptotic behaviors in the long-wavelength limit, as well as in the limit of large layer separation and strong magnetic fields. When interlayer tunneling is present, we clarify the magnetoplasmon dispersion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, by identifying the magnetoplasmon mode associated with each interband transition, as well as tunneling magnetoplasmons arising from interband transitions with the same Landau level index. Our study presents the hybridization between the modes governed by underlying symmetries, along with an enhanced tunneling magnetoplasmon gap exceeding the associated interband gap. The KMS-based analytic formalism thus provides a comprehensive physical understanding of magnetoplasmons in multilayer structures.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了一个用于断层泥的变分有限运动学框架，基于刚性粘塑性材料理论，专门化为Cam-Clay材料，模拟剪切和膨胀行为，并与实验数据对比验证。

Friction plays a fundamental role in many natural processes, including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Earthquakes occur when highly compressed fault surfaces accumulate large enough shear stresses, causing the faults to move relative to one another, or slip. The slip is accommodated within a thin layer of comminuted granular material -- called fault gouge -- between the fault surfaces. As a result, characterizing the mechanical behavior of fault gouge in response to shear is a major open problem in earthquake source physics. Modeling gouge is complicated by large deformations, inelasticity, rate dependence, and volumetric changes. As such, researchers typically rely on empirical formulations to capture the effective response. Here, we systematically develop a variational, finite-kinematics framework for fault gouge. We first describe a general theory for a rigid-viscoplastic, pressure-sensitive material, where the plasticity evolution follows from the principle of maximum dissipation. Then, we specialize the governing equations for a Cam-Clay material within a shearing and dilating layer. We rely on convexity considerations and experimental observations from consolidation tests of granular layers to calibrate the model and develop explicit solutions for the rate- and state- dependent response of the model to shear tests under constant compressive normal stress and prescribed shearing rate. To validate the model, we select common rate functions and compare numerical material point tests and theoretical solutions to standard laboratory experiments of shearing granular layers. Lastly, we discuss connections of the model to empirical rate-and-state friction laws.

Energy flows among coupled subsystems are essential for ultrafast dynamics and high-speed technologies. In magnetic materials, spin fluctuations -- magnons -- mediate these flows in ultrafast magnetism. Yet momentum-resolved access to low-energy magnons governing the microscopic dynamics has been lacking. Using time-resolved resonant diffuse scattering alongside complementary time-resolved X-ray techniques and quantum-kinetic simulations, we unveil the hierarchical energy pathways among correlated systems in the photoexcited antiferromagnet CuO. Above-bandgap excitation triggers near-instantaneous spin disorder, generating non-thermal magnons throughout reciprocal space within femtoseconds. Real-time momentum-resolved tracking reveals picosecond magnon quasi-thermalization, followed by nanosecond recovery via momentum-selective magnon-phonon scattering. The quasiparticle dispersion mismatch creates recovery bottlenecks that control non-equilibrium lifetimes. This microscopic framework transcends phenomenological models and generalizes across materials, establishing design principles for ultrafast control of material properties.

### Presence versus absence of charging energies in PbTe quantum dots

Charging energy ($E_C$) is essential in quantum dot (QD) devices. Previous studies on PbTe QDs have reported both the presence and absence of $E_C$. To resolve this ambiguity, we vary the QD size, i.e. the cross-sectional area of PbTe nanowires, and track the evolution of $E_C$. For large crosssectional areas ($\sim$ 16000 nm$^2$), the PbTe QDs exhibit no measurable $E_C$, while quantized levels are well resolved. Decreasing this area successively to 5000, 1500, and 500 nm$^2$, $E_C$ becomes finite and increases to 80, 160, and 210 $μ$eV, respectively. We further demonstrate the strong tunability of local gates, which can tune the PbTe device from the QD regime to the regime of ballistic transport. These results address concerns regarding the large dielectric constant of PbTe and provide key insights in engineering advanced PbTe quantum devices.

- **TL;DR**: 立方冰（ice Ic）通过低密度气体水合物前驱体实现实验可及性，测量其密度随温度变化，发现与六方冰（ice Ih）有强相似性，包括低温负热膨胀行为，计算表明立方冰是亚稳态且无法从普通六方冰前驱体获得。

The fundamental properties of ice have always attracted a lot of interest due to omnipresence of ice in many different natural contexts. Since cubic ice recently become experimentally accessible from a low-density gas hydrate precursor [1, 2], it has been possible to measure its density as a function of temperature in the whole thermodynamic range of metastability. We found strong analogies with respect to the other ice I polytype, i.e., hexagonal ice Ih [3], including the presence of a negative thermal expansion behavior at low temperature. Based on these results, a new enthalpy calculation quantifies the metastable nature of the cubic form and, consequently its inaccessibility from a "normal" ice Ih precursor.

We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a resonant level model coupled to a strongly interacting electron bath modeled by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Different from the well-investigated case of a structureless non-interacting Fermi gas bath leading to a temperature-independent exponential decay of the impurity orbital occupation, we find a temperature-dependent oscillatory decay. We attribute this difference to the lack of quasiparticles in the SYK model, which is reflected in its singular density of states at the Fermi level. Our results are exact and can be obtained analytically by mapping to a suitably structured Fermi gas bath as an ancillary model for the SYK bath.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过第一性原理计算重新评估了Cu₂O中缺陷对光致发光谱的影响，推翻了传统缺陷归属，提出了基于氧/铜间隙和分裂铜空位的新解释。

Cuprous oxide (Cu$_2$O) is of interest for several technologies, including solar cells, and more recently, quantum devices via Rydberg excitons. It's performance in these capacities is strongly affected by defects in the crystal. The current best diagnostic for the presence of defects in a sample is the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum, which shows a number of strong lines at energies below the band gap, with brightnesses dependent on the sample. However, the assignment of PL lines to particular defects has not been substantiated by modern theory. Using density functional theory (DFT), we investigate from first principles which native defects introduce electronic states within the Cu$_2$O band gap, and therefore would produce lines in the PL spectrum. We find that the accepted assignments of lines to simple oxygen and copper vacancies are unsupported, and propose a new assignment based on oxygen and copper interstitials, and (one of the possible) split copper vacancies, a significant step towards the use of PL as a diagnostic tool for Cu$_2$O crystal growth.

The dispersion curves for the electrons and holes in CsPbI$_3$ in the orthorhombic phase are calculated using the density functional theory (DFT), with the spin-orbit coupling taken into account. The effective masses of the charge carriers are obtained using the parabolic approximation of the dispersion curves in different directions in the $k$-space. It is found that the dispersion curves demonstrate strong nonparabolicity at energies above 0.2 eV for electrons and above 0.1 eV for holes, available for experimental study by the means of optical spectroscopy. We propose a model that describes the dispersion dependences of charge carriers at those energies, where the effective masses of the quasiparticles depend quadratically on the wave vector. An expression is obtained according to the model, which can accurately approximate the dispersion curves for the electron and the hole in all symmetric directions from the center to the boundary of the Brillouin zone.

The urgent need to mitigate rising atmospheric CO2 levels motivates the search for stable, efficient, and tunable adsorbent materials. In this study, we employ first-principles density functional theory to investigate the adsorption of CO2 molecules on two-dimensional hexagonal transition-metal diboride monolayers, M2B2 (M = Sc, Y, Ti, Zr, Nb). The adsorption energies, structural distortions, and bonding characteristics are systematically analyzed to understand how the metal center governs CO2 activation. The calculated adsorption energies range from -1.84 to -2.16 eV (or -1.98 to -4.42 eV), with Ti2B2 and Sc2B2 exhibiting the strongest CO2 binding, while Y2B2, Zr2B2, and Nb2B2 show moderately strong chemisorption. Adsorption induces significant molecular activation, evidenced by elongated C-O bonds (1.27-1.29 Angstrom) and bent O-C-O angles (129-132 degrees), compared to the linear gas-phase configuration (1.17 Angstrom, 180 degrees). Charge analysis further reveals substantial electron transfer from the monolayer to CO2, consistent with strong chemisorption and structural deformation. Correspondingly, the shift toward less negative IpCOHP(Ef) values indicates a pronounced weakening of the internal C-O bonds, reflecting increased population of antibonding pi* orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that the activated CO2 species is thermally sensitive: while most M2B2 surfaces retain stable adsorption at 300 K, Ti2B2 drives spontaneous CO2 dissociation into CO and O, revealing a temperature-assisted activation pathway. These findings highlight how the choice of transition metal tunes electronic interactions, adsorption energetics, and activation pathways on M2B2 surfaces. Overall, this work identifies two-dimensional transition-metal diborides as promising candidates for next-generation CO2 capture and activation technologies.

Strong light fields have unlocked previously unthinkable possibilities to tailor coherent electron trajectories, engineer band structures and shape emergent phases of matter all-optically. Unravelling the underlying quantum mechanisms requires a visualisation of the lightwave-driven electron motion directly in the band structure. While photoelectron momentum microscopy has imaged optically excited electrons averaged over many cycles of light, actual subcycle band-structure videography has been limited to small electron momenta. Yet lightwave-driven elementary processes in quantum materials often occur throughout momentum space. Here, we introduce attosecond-precision, subcycle band-structure videography covering the entire first Brillouin zone (BZ) and visualize one of the most fundamental but notoriously elusive strong-field processes: non-adiabatic Landau-Zener-Majorana (LZM) tunnelling. The interplay of field-driven acceleration within the Dirac-like band structure of graphene and periodic LZM interband tunnelling manifest in a coherent displacement and distortion of the momentum distribution at the BZ edge. The extremely non-thermal electron distributions also allow us to disentangle competing scattering processes and assess their impact on coherent electronic control through electron redistribution and thermalization. Our panoramic view of strong-field-driven electron motion in quantum materials lays the foundation for a microscopic understanding of some of the most discussed light-driven phenomena in condensed matter physics.

### Strain-enhanced edge ferromagnetism and bipolar magnetic semiconducting behavior in Janus graphene nanoribbons

Using first-principles density functional theory and determinant quantum Monte Carlo methods, we show that Janus graphene nanoribbons with topological defect arrays ($m=2$) exhibit robust intrinsic ferromagnetism across widths $W=2-6$, with bandgaps exceeding 200 $meV$ and stable ferromagnetic ground states. Notably, uniaxial tensile strain significantly enhances their ferromagnetic properties: at 25\% strain, the Curie temperature increases to $222K$, a fivefold improvement over unstrained systems and the highest reported for graphene-based nanoribbons. Strain also induces a reversible transition to a bipolar magnetic semiconductor, with spin-flipped valence and conduction band edges beyond 10\% strain. This dual functionality, strain-enhanced ferromagnetism and strain-induced spin flip, stems from strain-modulated $p_{z}$ orbital hybridization and strong direct exchange interaction. Among these, $W=5$ Janus graphene nanoribbons emerge as potential candidates for room-temperature spintronic devices and strain-programmable quantum transport systems.

### Non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity of integer and Jain fractional quantum Hall phases by Coulomb interactions

We proof the non-renormalization of the Hall viscosity by Coulomb interactions for integer and fractional quantum Hall Jain states building on previous results obtained for the Hall conductivity. We employ Wigner-Weyl calculus in order to represent the Hall viscosity in terms of a topological invariant comprised of Green functions and work within the composite fermion field theory model of Jain states of the fractional quantum Hall fluid presented by Lopez and Fradkin. The topological expression is first derived within the free field theory of electrons and explicitly calculated for this case as well as in the mean field approximation of the composite fermion theory Jain states. The topological orbital spin of composite fermions distinguishes their mean field treatment from that of electrons resulting in an additional topological contribution. We then argue that the introduction of Coulomb interactions does not lead to perturbative corrections of the Hall viscosity in both integer and fractional quantum Hall fluids. The proof relies on the assumptions of homogeneity and rotational invariance of an underlying sample modulo the vector potential giving rise to the homogeneous external magnetic field. These conditions imply a Hall viscosity per emergent quasiparticle number density quantized in units of one half times the average quasiparticle orbital spin or one quarter times the Wen-Zee shift. The latter features a contribution from the composite fermion topological orbital spin relative to that of electrons.

High entropy oxides (HEO) hold the potential to revolutionize the conventional material paradigms by leveraging high order of chemical disorder that induces highly desirable exotic phases for advanced applications. Here, we devise a methodology to enhance the efficiency of an artificial photonic synapse using a high entropy rare earth nickelate. Combined with epitaxial strain, we show that high entropy can further manipulate the phase of these locally disordered materials. Using time-averaged and time resolved Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as dynamic probe, for the first time we show a rare combination of i) crystal axis dependent insulator to metal THz electronic phase transition and ii) coexistence of negative and positive THz photoconductivity at room temperature. Detailed analysis within theoretical models, including density functional theory (DFT)-based band structure calculations, suggest origin of these properties as disproportionate ordering of oxygen vacancies. Based on these findings, a conceptual THz-based artificial photonic synapse is proposed. This work underlines the pivotal role of HEO in advancing diverse THz functionalities, representing a critical step toward futuristic applications like THz-based high-speed computing and communication with an emphasis in THz frequency domain.

Recent works have shown how the electrical properties of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) show a size-dependence in terms of resistivity, charge neutrality point (CNP) and band structure once their widths drop below approximately 50 nm. It has been observed that the CNP switches sign below a certain GNR width, and in this article, we explore this via computational modelling of the electric field and the conductance of GNRs in the presence of an AFM tip. We show that CNP is expected to shift towards lower values as GNR width reduces as a result of the significantly enhanced electric field around edges, but that a change in sign is not expected. We also show experimentally via high-resolution Scanning Gate Microscopy (SGM) that there does not appear to be any significant difference between the edges and the bulk of a GNR, indicating that the switch in CNP is not due to differential doping, and may instead be due to variations in the band structure as a function of size.

Copper-silver (CuAg) alloys are increasingly explored for applications in high-performance electrical and electronic systems, owing to their unique combination of high electrical and thermal conductivity and enhanced mechanical strength. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of how these alloys surface characteristics fundamentally influence properties remains largely underdeveloped. Here, we explored the complex interplay between surface texture morphology, layer composition, wetting, and optical properties of Cu, Ag, and CuAg thin films deposited on textured silicon substrates via magnetron sputtering. Employing data mining and machine learning techniques, we identified robust correlations between contact angle and surface fractal dimension across all layer types promoting Cassie-Baxter surface state formation. Our analysis revealed a significant connection between layer thickness and surface topography entropy deficit, suggesting a dynamic evolution of surface order/disorder during metal film growth. Furthermore, we observed that contact angle sensitivity to layer thickness implied a correlation with microstructure evolution. Through K-Means clustering, we successfully categorized the formed surface textures morphology. Finally, a Random Forest regression model was developed to accurately predict water contact angles (Mean Absolute Error around 5 deg) using only texture and optical parameters. The model, along with accompanying Python code, is publicly available. Our findings establish a pathway towards targeted surface texture morphology engineering for tailored material performance.

- **TL;DR**: 研究具有次近邻非互易跃迁的Haldane蜂窝模型变体，发现时间反演对称性保护的异常环、EP级联现象以及可动态稳定的非手性边缘态

We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$) hosts edge-states that have zero group velocity at $k_x=π$ and are therefore `non-chiral'. The edge states undergo a bifurcation transition at an exceptional point(EP)in the BZ and delocalise into the bulk. As the non-reciprocity is increased, the bulk states that are approaching each other are converted into pairs of EPs due to non-Hermiticity. As the non-reciprocity is further increased, there is a `Russian doll'-like nested proliferation of pairs of EPs, leading to an EP-cascade. The proliferation of EPs takes place only at specific values of the non-hermiticity parameter, leading to a step-like structure in the EP-pair density when plotted as a function of non-Hermiticity. Further, using wave packet dynamics, we find a tunable regime where the non-chiral edge states can be dynamically stabilised for large timescales. The `self-acceleration' term in the equations of motion tends to diffuse the wave packets into the bulk, thus making them `ephemeral edge states'. But we find that for small non-hermiticity, the edge localisation is stabilised until late times for sufficiently wider wave packets. Thus, we have brought forth an intriguing phenomenology of the exceptional phase of the non-reciprocal Haldane model, which may bear direct relevance for systems such as disordered Kitaev honeycomb model, wherein such ERs have been predicted.

- **TL;DR**: Ni-Si和Ni-Ge合金在辐照条件下表现出不同的微观结构演化，尽管它们具有相似的平衡相图和辐射诱导偏析现象。Ni-Si形成高密度Frank位错环，而Ni-Ge形成复杂位错阵列，且Ni3Ge沉淀物包裹He气泡，而Si则无此现象。

The interactions between chemical phase fields and structural defects play a key role in the properties of alloys. We illustrate the importance of these interactions in driven alloys, where defects are continuously being created, with particular focus on systems where radiation-induced segregation occurs. Specifically, we compare the microstructural evolution in undersaturated Ni-Si and Ni-Ge alloys during both 100 keV He and 2 MeV Ti irradiations. While the equilibrium phase diagrams of these systems are similar, and both systems show strong radiation-induced segregation, the evolving defect structures are remarkably different. Ni-Si reveals a high density of Frank loops, while Ni-Ge shows a complex array of dislocations. Moreover, a Ni3Ge precipitate shell is observed to coat He bubbles, while no segregation of Si is observed at such bubbles. We explain these differences in behaviors to solute drag by interstitial fluxes in Ni-Si vs solute drag by vacancy fluxes in Ni-Ge.

We present a rigorous derivation of the orbital magnetization for interacting electrons within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. Our method also allows us to derive formulas for the orbital magnetic susceptibility. The results are expressed entirely in terms of the self-consistent wavefunctions and the Hartree-Fock energy spectrum at zero magnetic field. We find that the formula for the orbital magnetization is the same as in the non-interacting case, provided that the Hamiltonian and Bloch wave functions are replaced by their Hartree-Fock counterparts. By contrast, the orbital magnetic susceptibility contains an additional interaction-induced contribution that cannot be obtained by such a replacement. We test the formulas on an interacting Rashba model, finding an agreement with calculations performed at a small but non-zero external magnetic field.

This brief report examines the influence of Ga/N flux conditions on Mn incorporation in GaN. Mn-doped GaN layers were grown at 680$^{\circ}$C by molecular beam epitaxy on a Ga-polar GaN(0001) template substrate under Ga-rich, N-rich, and no-flux conditions (i.e., Mn $δ$ doping). Mn incorporation was highest under N-rich condition, lowest under Ga-rich condition, and intermediate in the absence of Ga and N fluxes. For the growth conditions examined in this study, the corresponding Mn sticking coefficients, relative to that of the N-rich condition, were determined to be 0.31 for no-flux growth and 0.01 for the Ga-rich growth.

Previous studies of the growth of two-dimensional (2D) gallium selenide (GaSe) by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a gallium arsenide (GaAs) three-dimensional (3D) substrate have reported significant differences in growth morphology, polytype, and the nature of the interface. The results differ, ranging from GaSe 2D film growth at tilted 2D planes to observed spiral structures, thereby calling for a deeper understanding of the impact of the substrate interface on the growth of GaSe films. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reexamination of the growth mechanism of GaSe on GaAs substrates with (211)B and (001)B orientations, investigating the nature of the 2D/3D interface and the resulting morphology of the 2D GaSe films. We do this by investigating different methods of preparation of the GaAs substrate surface before the growth of GaSe by MBE, the importance of which has not been considered before. Our results resolve the mechanistic origin of tilted versus non-tilted 2D growth and establish a general interface-driven orientation selection rule linking substrate symmetry and dangling-bond coordination to layered heteroepitaxy. This framework provides a scalable interface-engineering pathway for deterministic control of layered chalcogenide heterostructures and enables wafer-scale integration with established semiconductor device platforms.

- **TL;DR**: 通过分子束外延在TiN导电层上生长自组装Al1-xScxN纳米线，并应用于压电纳米发电机，实现了比块体AlN高近两倍的压电响应

We study the molecular beam epitaxy of self-assembled Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires on conductive TiN layers and demonstrate their application in piezoelectric nanogenerators. Wurtzite Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires with uniform Sc incorporation are grown across a wide composition range (0&lt;x&lt;0.35). At substrate temperatures below 700 $^\circ{}$C, these nanowires exhibit an inversely tapered morphology, whereas higher temperatures favor the nucleation of additional branches due to a phase separation of Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N into wurtzite AlN and rock-salt ScN. Phase-pure Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N nanowires are integrated into vertical nanogenerators, where the metallic TiN substrate serves as bottom electrode. The fabricated polymer-nanowire composite devices achieve effective piezoelectric charge coefficients of up to 8.5 pC N$^{-1}$ at x=0.32, thus exceeding the piezoelectric response of bulk AlN by nearly a factor of two. Although the charge response remains lower compared to Al$\mathrm{_{1-x}}$Sc$\mathrm{_{x}}$N thin films, the reduced effective dielectric permittivity of the nanowire-polymer composites compensates the reduction in piezoelectric charge coefficient, eventually yielding a higher voltage response and comparable energy harvesting efficiency. Finally, effective medium modeling reveals that the device architecture is the primary factor limiting performance, providing general design principles for highly efficient nanowire-based piezoelectric energy harvesters.

Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors attracted growing interest in condensed-matter physics research. In this work, we explore the superconducting properties of surface-functionalized, out-of-plane ordered double transition-metal MXenes (o-MXenes), which exhibit distinctive structural and electronic characteristics. Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the effects of electronic structure, electron-phonon coupling (EPC), anharmonicity, and anisotropy effect in superconductivity properties of o-MXenes. We examine a wide range of o-MXene systems, M$_{2}$M$^\prime$X$_{2}$T$_{2}$ (M = Mo, W; M$^\prime$ = Sc, Ti, V, Mo, Zr, Nb, Ta; X = C, N), functionalized with F, O, Cl, and H groups. Out of 128 candidates, 32 compounds are found to be mechanically, dynamically, and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting superconducting transition temperatures (T$_{c}$) from 0.1 K to 52 K. Notably, the Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ compound achieves the highest T$_{c}$ of 52 K, with a superconducting gap of $\sim$10 meV. Solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equation reveals that Mo$_{2}$ScN$_{2}$O$_{2}$ is an anisotropic two-gap superconductor, and incorporating anharmonic effects decreases its T$_{c}$ slightly. We further analyze flat-band-induced EPC enhancement and present EPC matrix elements as functions of phonon wavevector q for distinct vibrational modes that show anharmonic behavior of these materials.

We fabricated a C60-based molecular spin photovoltaic device that integrated a photovoltaic response with the spin transport across the molecular layer. The photovoltaic response can be modified under the application of a small magnetic field, with a magnetophotovoltage of up to 5% at room temperature. Device functionalities include a magnetic current inverter and the presence of diverging magnetocurrent at certain illumination levels that could be useful for sensing. Completely spin-polarized currents could be created by balancing the external partially spin polarized injection with the photogenerated carriers.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种结合GW近似和Bethe-Salpeter方程的多体三步骤光发射模型，用于半导体光阴极，实现了从微观电子性质到宏观光发射观测的无参数预测。

The development of high-performance electron sources requires theoretical frameworks that accurately link the microscopic electronic properties of cathode materials to their macroscopic photoemission observables. Here, we present a many-body extension of the three-step photoemission model for semiconducting photocathodes, directly integrating the $GW$ approximation and the solution of the Bethe-Salpeter equation on top of density functional theory (DFT). This approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of standard DFT by explicitly accounting for quasiparticle and excitonic effects in the photoexcitation process. The quantum efficiency (QE) is evaluated by combining the ab initio absorption with an emission probability derived as an exciton-weighted average. We validate this model on representative alkali antimonides and demonstrate that a qualitative many-body description successfully captures complex spectral features that empirical models fail to reproduce. Furthermore, by incorporating macroscopic optical effects such as thin-film interference and polarization via Fresnel post-processing, we achieve quantitative agreement with experimental QE values without any adjustment. Minor discrepancies near the photoemission threshold are attributed to the idealized surface barrier adopted in the model and impurity effects in the samples, highlighting specific directions for future refinements. This work establishes a robust, parameter-free ab initio tool that bridges microscopic electronic correlation with macroscopic observables, providing a critical pathway for the rational design of next-generation electron sources.

- **TL;DR**: MnTe中175 cm⁻¹的"神秘模式"不是E2g声子，也不是对称性降低导致的"泄漏"声子，而是由空穴自掺杂引起的等离子体激元（电子激发）

MnTe has recently attracted exceptional attention due to its well-established altermagnetism, prompting a thorough reexamination of its properties. In particular, it was found that a Raman-active excitation at ~175 cm$^{-1}$, routinely assigned to the E2g phonon, is incompatible with this interpretation. It was further hypothesized that this mode is a "leakage", due to symmetry lowering, of an otherwise forbidden phonon. Here, using first-principles calculations, we decisively rule out this hypothesis and propose an alternative interpretation that the "mystery mode" is an electronic excitation, i.e., a plasmon, enabled by hole self-doping. The resolution of this mystery will require additional experiments and shed new light on the nature of electronic transport in MnTe.

Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究揭示了RAZIB中α-MnO₂阴极容量衰减的机制：Zn²⁺插层过程中形成的不稳定Zn弯曲配位环境促进了Mn空位形成和Mn溶解。

Currently explored rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion battery (RAZIB) cathode materials, such as $α$-MnO$_{2}$, suffer from severe capacity fade when cycling at rates appropriate for grid-scale operation. Mn dissolution has been previously identified as the cause of $α$-MnO$_{2}$ cathode degradation during RAZIB cycling, with conflicting evidence being found in support of the proposed Jahn-Teller effect-assisted charge disproportionation reaction as the mechanism behind Mn dissolution. In order to unveil the Mn dissolution mechanism in MnO$_{2}$ cathode cells under RAZIB operation conditions, the energetic feasibility for Mn vacancy formation was probed in both charged (MnO$_{2}$) and discharged (ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$) phases of $α$ and $λ$ polymorphs of MnO$_{2}$ using density functional theory. The formation of a Mn vacancy, and consequently the dissolution of Mn as Mn$^{2+}_{(aq)}$, was found to be thermodynamically feasible for the $α$-ZnMn$_{2}$O$_{4}$ phase due to the energetically unfavourable Zn bent coordination formed during the Zn$^{2+}$ intercalation process, indicating that Mn dissolution is promoted by an unstable Zn coordination environment. The theoretical calculations were then corroborated by operando $^{1}$H nuclear magnetic resonance experiments which captured the Mn dissolution occurring throughout the RAZIB discharge, with subsequent electrochemical deposition of the Mn atoms on the electrode during charge. The combined computational and experimental analysis reveals the critical role of defect energetics and coordination environment in driving active material dissolution, and consequently capacity fade, with the proposed mechanism also relevant for understanding cathode degradation in other intercalating ion battery chemistries.

A cornerstone of advanced materials design is establishing a framework for assembling nanoparticle superstructures with tailored symmetries. A longstanding challenge has been assembling diamond-like superstructures for photonic devices. Traditionally, such open superstructures require functionalized nanoparticles with directional or anisotropic interactions, reminiscent of valence bonding in a diamond. Here, we present a robust strategy for assembling valence-free nanoparticles into a broad array of cubic superstructures. By grafting nanoparticles with oppositely charged, end-functionalized water-soluble polymers of adjustable molecular weight, we gain control over electrostatic interactions and conformational constraints. This unified approach yields lattices analogous to rock salt, CsCl, zinc-blende, diamond, and the rare simple cubic phase, with tunable lattice constants. Theoretical models and simulations elucidate the underlying interactions, providing a framework for engineering valence-free nanoparticle superlattices.

Diamond to graphite transformation is a complex kinetically driven process which has been studied under various conditions for its fundamental importance. We report the transformation of diamond embedded ceramic matrix composites during hypersonic impact. Diamond particles embedded in cubic boron nitride matrix provide a superhard composite that was subjected to high impact collisions of metal projectiles travelling at speeds reaching Mach 8.45. Our observations suggest that the energy absorption and fracture of the composite is primarily enabled via the phase change of diamond into graphite. Characterization of the impact-fractured composite shows transformed diamond particles and provides details of the shock-induced phase transformation and the nature of diamond-graphite interfaces formed during rapid phase change. The study provides new understanding of phase transformation of diamond under extreme conditions.

Spinodal decomposition, a key mechanism to microstructure formation in materials, has long posed challenges for predictive modeling, due to the need for parameter-free approaches that accurately capture local energy landscapes. In this work, we propose an approach to predict spinodal behavior by introducing a disorder viscosity correction to bulk free energies computed from finite, small, representative cells. We approximate the energy penalty required to transition into a disordered state to enable the stabilization of locally concave bulk free energy regions - essential for interface formation - while suppressing long-range concentration fluctuations. This approximation circumvents the complexity of full ab initio parameterization of interfacial properties and is well-suited for high-throughput and machine-learning frameworks. Our approach captures the necessary physics underpinning spinodal kinetics, offering a scalable route to predict spinodal regions in compositionally complex and high-entropy materials.
