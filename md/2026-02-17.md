- **TL;DR**: 提出A3P-DMRG方法，通过自适应投影纯化伪玻色子技术压缩希尔伯特空间，专门用于研究稀薄晶格模型的基态，在低填充和弱耦合大系统中优于传统DMRG。

Simulating strongly correlated systems in two dimensions is notoriously challenging due to rapid entanglement growth and frustration. Here, we introduce the adaptive projected-purified pseudoboson density-matrix renormalization group (A3P-DMRG) tailored to explore the ground states of dilute lattice models. The method compresses cluster Hilbert spaces by retaining only the most probable low-occupation Fock states, identified via probabilistic bounds and refined through a self-consistent mean-field basis optimization. We demonstrate that A3P-DMRG is advantageous in low-filling and weak-coupling regimes for large system sizes where conventional DMRG struggles. This establishes the method as a versatile tool for studying dilute quantum many-body systems relevant to ultra-cold atom quantum simulators, photonic lattices, Moiré materials and quantum chemistry.

- **TL;DR**: 研究耦合自旋1/2梯子模型，通过引入空间各向异性的第三近邻水平相互作用，发现存在精确的二聚体基态，并识别出三种不同的量子相。

Spin ladders are key models that act as intermediaries between one-dimensional and two-dimensional spin systems. In this study, we examine a coupled spin-$1/2$ ladder, where frustrated ladders with leg, rung, and diagonal interactions are linked through a horizontal coupling. By introducing a spatially anisotropic third-nearest-neighbor interaction along the horizontal direction, the model was found to possess an exact dimer ground state, characterized by a product of singlets forming a columnar dimer phase. The model is analyzed using bond-operator mean-field theory (BOMFT) and the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). BOMFT reveals three distinct phases: a double-stripe ordered phase, a Néel ordered phase, and a quantum disordered dimerized phase. The critical points for the transitions are $J_1 = -0.81$ (double-stripe to dimerized) and $J_1 = 2.81$ (dimerized to Néel phase). DMRG results corroborate the exact ground state and refine the critical points to $J_1 = -0.79$ and $J_1 = 2.29$ for the respective transitions. Additionally, another transition is identified as the Néel order vanishes for $J_1 &gt; 4.5$. The static spin structure factor further corroborates the nature of the ordered phases.

- **TL;DR**: Ba4Ru3O10中发现隐藏的密度波不稳定性，该材料先前被认为是纯反铁磁体，在TA=100K发生相变，在T*=20K出现强非线性电荷输运特征，表明存在与反铁磁性交织的强钉扎集体电子态。

We report a hidden density-wave instability in the trimer-based ruthenate Ba4Ru3O10, previously regarded as a pure antiferromagnet with a phase transition at TA=100 K. This transition is manifested in lattice parameters, transport, thermodynamics, and magnetic susceptibility, yet remains remarkably insensitive to magnetic fields up to at least 14 T, indicating an electronically driven reconstruction. At much lower temperatures T*= 20 K, charge transport becomes strongly nonlinear, exhibiting distinct depinning thresholds, negative differential resistance, pronounced current- and frequency-dependence, and slow collective dynamics in the Hertz range. While each feature is characteristic of density-wave transport, their simultaneous occurrence in an antiferromagnetic oxide is unprecedented. All nonlinear signatures vanish upon only 3% Ir substitution, which preserves the crystal structure and insulating state, ruling out Joule heating or extrinsic artifacts. The wide separation between the electronic reconstruction at TA and the emergence of nonlinear dynamics at T* identifies Ba4Ru3O10 as a rare correlated system hosting a strongly pinned collective electronic state intertwined with antiferromagnetism.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究探索了具有交替磁性自旋分裂的强关联电子系统中磁关联的演化，发现通过自旋依赖的次近邻跃迁可以重塑费米面嵌套和范霍夫奇点，导致磁不稳定性从反铁磁序向非共线螺旋序转变。

The evolution of magnetic correlation in strongly correlated electron systems with altermagentic spin splitting remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate how spin splitting generated by spin-dependent next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ reshapes the Fermi surface nesting and van Hove singularities in the two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model, leading evolution of magnetic instabilities. Using the constrained-path quantum Monte Carlo method, we find the dominant magnetic correlation as functions of the filling and $t'/t$ by computing the momentum-resolved spin structure factor. The analysis reveals a transition from antiferromagnetic $(π,π)$ order in the isotropic, half-filled system to non-collinear spiral $(π,q)$ order upon increasing the spin-dependent anisotropy or doping away from half-filling, ultimately entering a short-range correlation regime where stripe and spiral correlation coexist. These findings highlight a possible route to realizing spiral correlation in altermagnetic systems, potentially providing a platform for spintronic devices that exploit non-collinear spin textures.

### Shunt-controlled resistive state of superconducting wires

The use of resistive shunts in superconducting electronics is vast and versatile, to dampen oscillations in junctions, stabilize switching behavior, aid current sensing, divert current during quenches, and protect both the superconductor and the circuit from damage. In single-photon detection by superconducting nanowires, the shunt is crucial for the timely relaxation of the sensor between the events to detect. Here we step out from the superconducting state and discuss the effect of the shunt resistor on the resistive state of a superconducting wire, at elevated currents still below the critical current for the transition to the normal state. We reveal how the shunt resistance controls the system dynamics and the onset of different resistive phases that include hot-spot and phase-slippage events. The accompanying dynamic current redistribution in the circuit also affects the local heating properties and additionally contributes to the control of the resistive state, particularly important at the elevated operation temperatures.

- **TL;DR**: 硅基锂离子电池早期容量增益现象分析：识别四种容量增加机制，建立定量框架解释电极电位变化对锂离子库存的影响

Silicon-containing lithium-ion batteries can exhibit capacity gain early in life, which makes forecasting future cell behavior difficult. We have observed these anomalous trends even in conditions where known mechanisms, such as overhang equalization and excessive electrolyte oxidation, are unlikely to be significant. Here, we combine simulations and experiments to analyze four cases that can produce increased capacity in Si cells. Three of these pathways relate to break-in processes, where improved mass and charge transport can lead to increased access to active electrode domains and decreased cell impedance. The fourth case occurs at high levels of prelithiation, when the positive electrode (PE) is completely replenished with Li+ at the end of cell discharge. We show that the commonality among these mechanisms is that the underlying transformations change the potentials experienced by electrodes at the end of half-cycles, increasing the Li+ inventory available to the cell. A quantitative framework to describe these effects is presented, enabling these ideas to be extended to other battery systems.

### Probing near-field EM fluctuations in superparamagnetic CoFeB with NV quantum dephasometry

- **TL;DR**: 使用氮空位中心量子退相干技术非侵入式探测纳米CoFeB层的超顺磁自旋动力学，揭示其低频近场电磁涨落特性

Superparamagnetism in nanoscale magnetic layers is a critical property for a wide range of spintronic-based sensor and computing applications. While conventional magnetization measurements can detect superparamagnetic signatures, they often require the application of high perturbative fields and are difficult to implement for magnetic layers integrated within functional devices. In this study, we non-invasively investigate the superparamagnetic spin dynamics of a nanoscale CoFeB layer of thickness 1.1 nm, deposited on a diamond substrate, by probing its low-frequency near-field electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers-based quantum dephasometry. Our measurements reveal an unconventional, non-monotonic temperature dependence of the dephasing time of NV centers, which we attribute to EM fluctuations produced by thermally driven superparamagnetic domain flipping in CoFeB. Our findings are further supported by the theoretical interpretation of the dephasing dynamics of NV centers and the complementary SQUID-based magnetization characterizations of the CoFeB layer. Additionally, exploiting the technique of NV dephasometry, we extract the spectral density of the EM fluctuations in CoFeB, which is used to isolate different components of the EM fluctuations acting on NV centers. We also measure the CoFeB-to-NV distance-dependent coherence times of NV centers to investigate the effect of the dimensionality of the CoFeB layer on the generated near-field EM fluctuations. These results provide critical insight into the magnetization dynamics and near-field EM environment of nanoscale magnetic layers. It also has significant implications for the development of hybrid quantum spintronic devices and applications involving nanoscale opto-magnetic materials.

### Geometry Challenges Entropy: Regime-DependentRectification in Nanofluidic Cascades

- **TL;DR**: 几何不对称性（漏斗形状）可在无外力驱动下产生显著的反向整流效应，窄侧积累粒子数达宽侧5倍以上，挑战传统熵输运理论

Can geometry alone reshape equilibrium? Cascaded nanofluidic chambers show complex accumulation patterns, traditionally attributed to geometric diode effects. We use 3D molecular dynamics to decouple funnel rectification from boundary reflection. Simulations with argon parameters (r = 0.19 nm) reveal a striking "reverse" rectification in a 2-chamber setup: the narrow side accumulates over 5x more particles (N_1/N_0 = 5.37 +/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.0001). In a 10-chamber argon cascade, this effect drives massive downstream accumulation. A symmetric control (w_L = w_R) eliminates the gradient, confirming that funnel asymmetry - not boundary/edge effects - is the primary driver in the ballistic regime. By contrast, the super-atom regime is dominated by boundary reflection. Our results challenge standard entropic transport theory and provide design rules for passive, geometry-driven density gradients - no pump, no drive.

- **TL;DR**: 使用遗传算法编程热力学计算机，使控制系统散热与信息自由度散热处于同一数量级，并实现热量从信息自由度向控制单元转移

Landauer's principle bounds the heat generated by logical operations, but in practice the thermodynamic cost of computation is dominated by the control systems that implement logic. CMOS gates dissipate energy far above the Landauer bound, while laboratory demonstrations of near-Landauer erasure rely on external measurement or feedback systems whose energy costs exceed that of the logic operation by many orders of magnitude. Here we use simulations to show that a genetic algorithm can program a thermodynamic computer to implement logic operations in which the total heat emitted by the control system is of a similar order of magnitude to that of the information-bearing degrees of freedom. Moreover, the computer can be programmed so that heat is drawn away from the information-bearing degrees of freedom and dissipated within the control unit, suggesting the possibility of computing architectures in which heat management is an integral part of the program design.

- **TL;DR**: 钒掺杂（≤10 at.% V）可有效调控β-TaON的电子结构，改善其光学和光电化学性能，实现可见光吸收红移和自发全水分解。

The application of beta-TaON for solar-driven water splitting is hindered by limitations in phase purity, stoichiometry, crystallinity, visible-light absorption, carrier mobility, and high recombination rates. This study investigates the impact of vanadium doping (0-25 at.% V) on the structural, optoelectronic, and photoelectrochemical properties of beta-TaON using both experimental and density functional theory (DFT) approaches. Phase-pure beta-TaON is retained up to 10 at.% V, beyond which secondary phases (Ta2O5 and VN) form, indicating a threshold of ~10 at.% under the applied synthesis conditions. All samples exhibit a porous microstructure. Increasing vanadium content induces a redshift in the absorption edge, reducing the bandgap from 2.72 eV (undoped) to 2.38 eV at 25 at.% V for the main beta-TaON phase, in agreement with DFT results. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms substitutional incorporation of V5+ for Ta5+ in the beta-TaON lattice. DFT calculations reveal reduced electron effective mass, enhanced n-type conductivity, and favorable band edge shifts enabling spontaneous overall water splitting at &lt;=10 at.% V. Photoelectrochemical measurements show improved photocurrent and more negative onset potentials for 5-10 at.% V, while higher V doping degrades performance due to phase segregation, which likely increases recombination and hinders interfacial charge transport. Vanadium doping (&lt;=10 at.% V) is an effective strategy for tuning the electronic structure and enhancing the optical properties and photoelectrochemical performance of beta-TaON.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种统一框架，通过扩展相干态到Chern能带中的相干类态，从局域基角度理解量子霍尔效应和Chern绝缘体，并构建了基于这些基的局域排斥相互作用哈密顿量。

In topological bands, it is impossible to construct exponentially localized Wannier functions while preserving the symmetries. Instead, in quantum Hall systems, one can define an overcomplete basis of spatially localized coherent states. In this work, we propose a unified framework for understanding the quantum Hall effect and Chern insulators from the perspective of localized bases, by extending the overcomplete basis of coherent states to Chern bands in terms of coherent-like states. Specifically, by representing both coherent states and coherent-like states as wave packets defined on a band, the difference between them can be encoded solely in the functional form of the wave packet in momentum space. Furthermore, for filling factor $ν=1/3$, we define a local repulsive interaction Hamiltonian based on these bases and discuss properties of its ground states. In particular, by relating this Hamiltonian to previously studied models, we show that in quantum Hall systems it possesses exactly zero-energy ground states with topological degeneracy, thereby confirming that it serves as a model for fractional quantum Hall systems. In addition, we numerically verify that the Hamiltonian possesses topological degeneracy for representative Chern insulator models. An advantage of this formulation is that it allows fractional quantum Hall systems and various fractional Chern insulator systems to be discussed within a unified framework using the same Hamiltonian form. In addition, we discuss that coherent-like states can also be defined in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulators. Corresponding to the fermionic time-reversal symmetry of the system, Kramers-degenerate coherent-like states can be naturally defined. The localized basis constructed from coherent-like states is expected to be useful for describing strongly correlated topological phases in flat-band systems.

### Metal hydrides achieve high-Tc superconductivity at low pressure by mimicking high-pressure H3S chemical bonding

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种通过模拟高压H3S的键合特性来同时优化金属氢化物结构稳定性和高温超导性的新机制，以Li3CuH4为例展示了在低压下实现高Tc超导的可能性。

Compressed hydrides are promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, yet achieving simultaneous structural stability and high-Tc at low pressures remains challenging. Here, we introduce a new mechanism for accomplishing this goal by mimicking the bonding characteristics of high-pressure H3S within metal hydrides. Using Li3CuH4 as an example, its Cu-H covalent interaction effectively mimics the core function of the S-H bonding in H3S. This interaction not only induces a high hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at the Fermi level, but also softens the hydrogen phonon modes, thereby significantly enhancing the electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, embedding the strongly ionic Li3H lattice into the covalent Cu-H framework stabilizes the structure at significantly low pressures via a chemical-template effect, while maintaining high-Tc. Li3CuH4 exhibits excellent thermodynamic stability at 20 GPa, with a Tc of 39.25 K at 12 GPa. Further comprehensive high-throughput studies on Li3MH4 (M = transition metal) compounds uncover general principles applicable to a broader range of compounds. This work establishes a new paradigm for the simultaneous optimization of the stability and high-temperature superconductivity of metal hydrides through complementary sublattice interactions, thus advancing the search for practical and viable superconducting materials.

- **TL;DR**: 在LAMMPS中实现了一个高效的路径积分分子动力学（PIMD）方法，支持常用功能并利用MPI架构，相比i-PI实现数倍加速，具有良好的并行性能。

Path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD), which maps a quantum particle onto a fictitious classical system of ring polymers and propagates the "beads" of this extended classical system using molecular dynamics, is widely used to capture nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in molecular simulations. Accurate PIMD calculations typically require a large number of beads and are therefore computationally demanding. While software packages such as i-PI offer comprehensive PIMD functionality, the high efficiency of simulations driven by machine learning interatomic potentials, such as Deep Potential (DP), calls for more efficient PIMD implementations that fully exploit modern massively parallel supercomputers. Here we present fix pimd/langevin, an efficient PIMD implementation in LAMMPS that supports commonly used features and leverages the Message Passing Interface architecture of LAMMPS to achieve high computational efficiency. We demonstrate the usage and validate the correctness of our code using liquid water as a representative example, and provide a comprehensive overview of the supported features. Then we discuss several important technical aspects of the implementation. Using DP simulations of water as a benchmark, we show that our implementation achieves several-fold acceleration compared to i-PI. Finally, we report strong and weak scaling results that demonstrate the favorable parallel performance of our code.

### Dynamical metastability and transient topological magnons in interacting driven-dissipative magnetic systems

- **TL;DR**: 该研究将动力学亚稳态从线性量子系统扩展到非线性相互作用体系，在磁性异质结构中发现了尺寸依赖的自旋倾角、不稳定平衡态异常吸引等非线性现象，为自旋电子器件提供新物理机制。

Metastability, i.e., partial relaxation to long-lived, quasi-stationary states before true asymptotic equilibrium sets in, emerges ubiquitously in classical and quantum dynamical systems as a result of timescales separation. In open quantum systems, an intrinsically nonequilibrium analogue, dynamical metastability, can originate from the spectral geometry of a non-Hermitian operator. In noninteracting models, this mechanism produces boundary-sensitive anomalous relaxation, transient amplification, and topologically mandated long-lived edge modes, all of which are enhanced as system size grows. Here we extend dynamical metastability into the nonlinear, interacting regime and identify magnetic heterostructures as a natural platform for its exploration. We introduce an interacting spin Lindbladian whose linearized magnon dynamics map onto a dynamically metastable Hatano-Nelson chain, and show that dynamical metastability in the noninteracting limit seeds genuinely nonlinear phenomena, including size-dependent spin dipping and anomalous attraction to unstable equilibria. Long-lived edge states associated to topologically mandated Dirac bosons persist under nonlinearities and disorder. We further analyze the magnetization dynamics in magnetic multilayers within the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski framework, identifying Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, nonlocal damping, and spin-transfer torque as control parameters governing bulk-boundary stability mismatch and band topology. While all the distinctive dynamical phenomena previously identified reappear in this experimentally relevant setting, the LLGS framework also supports multistability and limit cycles that are absent in the quantum model. Our results constitute the first systematic study of dynamical metastability in nonlinear dynamics, directly relevant to spin-torque oscillator arrays, magnonic devices, and beyond.

- **TL;DR**: 在VASP中实现了平面波基组的辅助场量子蒙特卡洛方法，结合投影缀加波形式，通过精确反演重叠算符保持立方标度，在完整基组极限下计算材料结构性质。

We present a plane-wave (PW) implementation of the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method within the projector augmented-wave (PAW) formalism in the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). By employing an exact inversion of the PAW overlap operator, our approach maintains cubic scaling while naturally operating at the complete basis set limit defined by the PW cutoff. We benchmark this framework by calculating the equilibrium lattice constants and bulk moduli of C, BN, BP, and Si. Our analysis demonstrates that AFQMC systematically corrects the lack of long-range screening in MP2 and the missing higher-order exchange in RPA. We identify RPA as the optimal reference method due to the rapid convergence of the remaining short-range correlations with respect to supercell size. The resulting lattice constants exhibit a mean absolute relative error of 0.14 % relative to experiment, establishing the method as a rigorous benchmark tool for structural properties in condensed matter systems.

### Operationalizing the Arrow of Time in mesoscopic: A Unified Framework for Non-equilibrium Matter

- **TL;DR**: 论文提出热力学惯性力作为非平衡系统的基本原理，建立统一的微状态序列-模式耦合理论，解决了非高斯参数和聚合物常数的长期难题。

What sustains a non-equilibrium system against fluctuations from within - as witnessed in non-equilibrium steady states, glassy relaxation, and even living organisms? Here we show that the arrow of time itself can be operationalized into a measurable physical quantity on mesoscopic particles - the eigen-phase displacement. This displacement gives rise to a non-local generalized force, the thermodynamic inertia force, which emerges from the integrated contribution of local constraints rather than as a conventional local force. It actively counteracts fluctuations and its algebraic structure is a semi-group, fundamentally distinct from the Lie group of Newton inertia, thereby encoding the irreversibility of time's arrow. Building on this foundation, we construct a unified Microstate-Sequence-Mode-Coupling (MSS-MCT) theory. Its thermodynamic limit is defined by Microstate Sequence (MSS) theory, and its dynamical action is captured by a consequent mode-coupling theory (MCT). From this single first-principles framework, we simultaneously resolve two long-standing puzzles: it predicts the giant non-Gaussian parameter(1~10), closing the order-of-magnitude gap with experiments that standard mode-coupling theory could not explain; and it delivers a first-principles, non-fitting derivation of the universal polymer constant $C_{1} \approx 16.7$ with merely 1 percent error - the most accurate theoretical prediction to date, dramatically surpassing the Adam-Gibbs and others. Our work establishes thermodynamic inertia as a foundational principle for non-equilibrium matter, bridging thermodynamic and dynamic descriptions from glassy relaxation to the maintenance of life.

Lowering the operating temperature of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) is essential for improving durability and enabling large scale commercialization. Mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, such as Nd$2$Ni${1-x}$Cu$x$O${4+δ}$ (NNCO), offer attractive cathode properties due to their high oxygen transport and favourable defect chemistry. In this work, we investigate the fabrication of Nd$2$Ni${0.8}$Cu${0.2}$O${4+δ}$ thin films using a room temperature RF sputtering process followed by moderate temperature annealing. To simplify deposition, a single stoichiometric target was employed, despite the compositional challenges posed by elements with different sputtering yields. We examine the effect of sputtering power density on phase formation and film stoichiometry through X-ray diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry, Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy, and temperature dependent resistivity measurements. Increasing the sputtering power density strongly reduces the presence of spurious phases and promotes stabilization of the desired n=1 Ruddlesden-Popper phase. Films deposited at 230 W (3.1 W cm$^{-2}$) exhibit a predominant NNCO structure, elemental ratios close to nominal composition, and resistivity values consistent with bulk materials. These findings demonstrate that high power sputtering combined with ex situ annealing enables the production of NNCO thin films suitable for SOFC cathodes. The results support the potential of PVD based approaches for scalable fabrication of advanced SOFC components.

Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.

The N-layer 2H-stacked transition metal dichalcogenides 2H-NbSe2 and 2H-TaS2 are superconductors in which each quasi-two-dimensional layer breaks inversion symmetry. In this paper, we show that, as for the individual monolayers, it is crucial to include all pockets at the Fermi surface to accurately determine the upper critical field. Furthermore, we propose an experiment where a distinct scaling with a varying displacement field is predicted for an intralayer spin-singlet order in a bilayer. The scaling of the upper critical field with external tuning parameters can thus be used to extract information about the spin-symmetry of the superconducting order. We also explore the possibility of a mixed-parity spin-singlet and -triplet order parameter. In that case, we predict that the experimentally observable scaling would remain that of the spin-singlet component.

- **TL;DR**: EH-TEMPO算法通过有效哈密顿量方法重构Feynman-Vernon影响泛函计算，显著提升开放量子系统非马尔可夫动力学模拟效率，在GPU上实现17.5倍加速。

Accurately simulating the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems remains a significant challenge. While the recently proposed time-evolving matrix product operator (TEMPO) algorithm based on path integrals successfully circumvents the exponential scaling associated with memory length, its reliance on layer-by-layer tensor contractions and compressions leads to steep scaling with respect to the system Hilbert space dimension. In this work, we introduce the effective Hamiltonian-based TEMPO (EH-TEMPO) algorithm, which reformulates the calculation of the Feynman-Vernon influence functional as an imaginary time evolution governed by an effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate that this effective Hamiltonian admits a highly compact matrix product operator representation, enabling substantial compression with negligible loss of accuracy. Combining a one-shot global evolution with a backward retrieval approach, EH-TEMPO significantly reduces algorithmic complexity and is naturally suited for GPU acceleration. We benchmark the method against the process tensor TEMPO algorithm using the 7-site Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex model. The results demonstrate that EH-TEMPO achieves numerically exact accuracy with superior efficiency, delivering speedups of up to 17.5x on GPU hardware compared to standard CPU implementations.

Charged excitons, or trions, offering unique spin and charge degrees of freedom, have primarily been investigated in doped systems where charges are long considered indispensable. Here, we present an alternative route to ultra-efficient trion emission from an intrinsic, defect-free semiconductor via a transfer mechanism. By exciting trions in two-dimensional tungsten-diselenide donors and transferring them into one-dimensional carbon-nanotube acceptors in mixed-dimensional heterostructures, we circumvent the usual carrier requirement, overcoming intrinsic Auger-quenching limitations. Benefitting from a reservoir effect induced by dimensional heterogeneity, this process achieves trion emission efficiencies increased by over 100-fold compared to conventional doping-based approaches, and remains robust across diverse doping conditions. Our findings extend the exciton transfer paradigm to the three-body quasiparticles, offering a new platform for advancing excitonic physics and trion-based optoelectronic/spintronic applications.

### Non-monotonic Irreversibility in Polytropic Steering

The efficient manipulation of thermodynamic states within the finite time is fundamentally constrained by the intrinsic dissipative cost. While the slow-driving regime is well-characterized by a universal $1/τ$-scaling of irreversibility, the physics governing fast, non-adiabatic transitions remains elusive. Here, we propose the polytropic steering protocols that provide an exact analytical bridge between the isothermal and adiabatic limits for Brownian particles far-from-equilibrium. We demonstrate that for any protocol duration $τ$, the system can be precisely steered along a prescribed polytropic trajectory, revealing a striking non-monotonic dependence of irreversibility on the driving rate. Contrary to the near-equilibrium paradigm where faster driving necessitates higher energetic costs, we identify a most-irreversible timescale, beyond which dissipation is anomalously suppressed by rapid driving. By mapping these protocols onto a broad class of controllable thermodynamic cycle, we establish power-efficiency tradeoffs and position the polytropic index as a genuine thermodynamic control knob for the rational design of high-speed, high-performance microscopic thermal machines.

This study presents an eco-friendly and bio-based symmetric supercapacitor using cotton textile waste-derived hydrogels as electrolytes and chitosan-based carbon electrodes as metal-free charge-storage components. Cotton-derived hydrogels were synthesized via an alkaline dissolution-gelation route and modified with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) to enhance ionic conductivity. The ionic modification increased the hydrogel conductivity from 17.1 to 37.8 mS cm^-1, confirming a nearly twofold improvement in ion transport efficiency. The resulting hydrogel exhibited improved thermal stability, homogeneous ionic transport, and strong polymer-ion interactions confirmed by FTIR and TGA analyses. In a symmetric device, the ion-modified hydrogel enables reduced equivalent series resistance, faster charge-transfer kinetics, and a short time constant (tau = 3.2 s), comparable to commercial energy-storage systems. After 1000 cycles, the device exhibits a 12.3% increase in specific capacitance, confirming stable proof-of-concept operation. Cycling leads to a moderate increase in R_ESR (18 to 22 ohm) and tau (3.2 to 4.1 s), indicating slower charge-ion redistribution. Notably, this R_ESR includes the contribution of the test-cell setup; in compact coin-type configurations, the resistance would be considerably lower. EIS reveals a concurrent rise in interfacial resistive terms, consistent with post-cycling hydrogel darkening and FTIR evidence of Fe-SCN coordination, suggesting that resistance buildup mainly originates from minor Fe-SCN interactions when the expelled liquid reaches the stainless-steel collector, rather than from loss of capacitive functionality. Overall, these results demonstrate the viability of cotton waste-derived hydrogels and chitosan-based electrodes as sustainable components for green energy storage, offering a recyclable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional systems.

Strong correlation, when combined with dissipation in open systems, can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we study nontrivial interplays between non-Fermi liquid behaviors emerging from strong correlation and non-Hermiticity arising from open systems. We propose a practical physical setup that realizes a non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model. We identify a weak-coupling local moment fixed point and a strong-coupling non-Fermi liquid fixed point under PT symmetry, both are enriched by the non-Hermitian effect. Remarkably, universal unconventional Kondo conductance behaviors are found for both cases, which are distinct from all previously studied Kondo systems. Particularly, we show that an anomalous upturn of conductance could take place with increasing the temperature, originating from the interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity. Our results identify a novel class of transport phenomena unrecognized before, driven by intertwined effects of correlation and dissipation.

Geometry design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors. Topology optimization is one of the most powerful approaches used to determine structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of both low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.

A framework for reconstructing the one-electron spinors $Γ_7$ and $Γ_8$ of Cr$^{3+}$ embedded in glasses from optical measurements has been developed. From the spinors, the spin-orbital von Neumann entropy can be calculated. An aluminum phosphate glass doped with 1 mol % chromium is prepared, and its optical absorption spectrum is recorded to validate the method. The spin-orbit coupling constant, crystal field strength, and Racah parameters are obtained from the absorption spectrum. Subsequently, the spin-orbital entanglement entropy is calculated and analyzed for a family of chromium-doped glasses. It is found that individually, neither the spin-orbit coupling constant, nor the crystal field strength, nor the Racah parameters correlate with the entanglement entropy. In contrast, the ratio between the spin-orbit coupling constant and the crystal field strength correlates linearly with the entanglement entropy.

We theoretically propose and analyze a Josephson-like magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure that exhibits quantum spin dynamics analogous to those in superconducting Josephson junctions. By exploiting the isomorphism between the equations of motion for low-dissipation MTJs with easy-plane anisotropy and the Josephson phase dynamics, we construct a theoretical framework for realizing spintronic qubits. Within this framework, we identify the physical parameters -- such as anisotropy constants, Gilbert damping, spin current amplitude, and geometric factors -- that govern the transition from classical to quantum behavior. We show that different types of spintronic qubits, including analogs of charge, flux, and transmon superconducting qubits, can be implemented depending on the hierarchy of energy scales. A Hamiltonian formalism is developed for each regime, enabling an analytical treatment of the two-level quantum dynamics and estimation of coherence times. In particular, we demonstrate that the spin current can be used not only to excite but also to stabilize the qubit states through dissipation control. These findings provide a route toward integrating spintronic qubits into CMOS-compatible architectures and lay the groundwork for a fully spintronic platform for quantum computation.

### Bulk-boundary correspondence in topological two-dimensional non-Hermitian systems: Toeplitz operators and singular values

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于Toeplitz算子和奇异值的非厄米系统体边对应理论，取代传统的基于特征值的方法，为拓扑保护提供了更稳定的基础。

In contrast to eigenvalue-based approaches, we formulate the bulk-boundary correspondence for two-dimensional non-Hermitian quadratic lattice Hamiltonians in terms of Toeplitz operators and singular values, which correctly capture the stability, localization, and scaling of edge and corner modes. We show that singular values, rather than eigenvalues, provide the only stable foundation for topological protection in non-Hermitian systems because they remain robust under translational-symmetry-breaking perturbations that destabilize the eigenvalue spectrum, rendering it unsuitable for topological classification. Building on Toeplitz operator theory, we establish general results for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians defined on half and quarter planes, relating the topological indices of the associated Toeplitz operators to the number of finite-size singular values that are separated from the bulk singular-value spectrum and vanish in the thermodynamic limit. This yields a precise bulk-boundary correspondence for edge and corner modes, including higher-order topological phases, without requiring crystalline symmetries. We illustrate our general results with detailed examples exhibiting topologically protected families of edge states, coexisting edge and corner modes, and phases with both gapped bulk and edges supporting only stable corner modes. The latter is exemplified by a non-Hermitian generalization of the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model.

### Altermagnetism, ARPES, symmetry, non-relativistic band splitting

Altermagnetism arises from composite real-space and spin-space symmetries, combining zero net magnetization with pronounced momentum-dependent spin splitting. This review highlights the pivotal role of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), along with its spin-resolved (SARPES) and circular-dichroism (CD-ARPES) variants, in directly visualizing nonrelativistic band splitting and spin textures in altermagnets. Within the spin-group framework, we distinguish ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic orders and elucidate the symmetry origin of spin polarization. We then systematically review representative systems: the debated d-wave prototype RuO2, layered d-wave altermagnets KV2Se2O and Rb1-delta V2Te2O, and a series of g-wave compounds including MnTe (domain-tunable) and CrSb (topological), together with the noncoplanar antiferromagnet MnTe2 and other emerging candidate platforms. Overall, ARPES has become a key probe for resolving symmetry-driven spin splitting. Future advances in micro/nano-beam and in-situ spectroscopies, combined with strain and domain engineering, heterostructure design, and exploration of broader unconventional magnetic states, are expected to drive the joint evolution of altermagnetism and photoemission spectroscopy, paving the way for spintronic and correlated quantum research.

We present a first-principles investigation of magnetic exchange interactions and critical behavior in (111)-oriented (LaMnO$_3$)$_{2n}$|(SrMnO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices for $n=2,4,6$. For all superlattices under investigation, we find robust half-metallic ferromagnetism extending across all the layers of both component regions. Changing octahedral tilt patterns is found to have negligible effects on the magnetic properties, despite determining the presence or absence of small Jahn-Teller distortions. The analysis of the response of the magnetic coupling to a variation of the Coulomb interaction parameters demonstrates that ferromagnetism is driven by a double-exchange mechanism involving itinerant $e_g$ electrons, while its final strength is hampered by antiferromagnetic contributions due to the superexchange of localized $t_{2g}$ electrons. Multi-scale simulations based on atomistic spin dynamics show that the thinnest superlattices, $n=2,4$, possess an ordering temperature that is at least comparable to that of La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$. Conversely, as thickness increases, a two-phase behavior emerges, where the SrMnO$_3$ region loses long-range order faster than the LaMnO$_3$ region. While the global ordering temperature increases together with thickness, we argue that the high-temperature regime for the observed two-phase behavior is not representative of the real physical system, which will undergo a combined electronic, magnetic and structural phase transition as soon as the long-range order is lost inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. This study provides insights into the emergent magnetic phases and transition temperatures relevant to oxide heterostructures.

Neuromorphic computing aims to reproduce the energy efficiency and adaptability of biological intelligence in hardware. Superconducting devices are an attractive platform due to their ultra-low dissipation and fast switching dynamics. Here we introduce a shunted superconducting wirelet as an artificial neuron, representing the simplest possible superconducting neuron implementation. This minimal design, a single superconducting channel with a resistive shunt, enables straightforward fabrication, electronic control, and high scalability. The neuron exhibits spiking voltage behavior driven by the interplay of resistive switching and relaxation, with key properties such as threshold, firing frequency, and refractory time tunable via applied current, temperature, and shunt resistance. We further show that the resulting temporal voltage signals can be incorporated into a training algorithm to achieve accurate pattern recognition, demonstrating suitability for neuromorphic tasks. Finally, we discuss on-chip training using similar wirelets with gated synaptic weights, establishing a scalable, energy-efficient building block for cryogenic artificial intelligence hardware, integrable with other emergent superconducting technologies.

Machine-learning potentials (MLPs) have become important tools for modern molecular simulations. However, developing models that simultaneously achieve high accuracy and high computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. In this work, we extend the recently proposed MB-PIPNet framework to general covalently bonded molecular systems by combining monomer-based energy decomposition, permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) descriptors, and neural networks within a fragmentation-based strategy. Within this framework, the total potential energy is represented as a sum of effective monomeric contributions, where PIPs provide compact and chemically motivated descriptions of both monomer internal structures and their local chemical environments. As a proof-of-concept application, we apply the MB-PIPNet framework to linear alkanes, using n-Tetradecane as a representative system, and benchmark its performance against established atomistic machine-learning models. The resulting MB-PIPNet potential accurately reproduces reference ab initio electronic energies and reliably captures key molecular properties, including torsional potential energy profiles, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and vibrational power spectra obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Importantly, MB-PIPNet demonstrates a substantial advantage in computational efficiency over other MLP models for combined energy and force evaluations. These results establish MB-PIPNet as a scalable and efficient framework for constructing MLPs, providing an additional route for large-scale quantum and classical simulations of complex molecular systems.

Stacking geometry in multilayer graphene (MLG) provides an interesting degree of freedom to engineer its electronic structure near the Fermi level, wherein the linear bands in single layer graphene could retain or evolve into parabolic or flat bands. Using a tight-binding model, we carried out a detailed analytical analysis of the electronic band structures for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. We show that their low energy band dispersions near the Fermi level may be deduced from its substacks in isolation. The analytical solutions of the momenta with zero eigenvalue for an AA stacking allows us to generalize the results of the zero energy momenta for arbitrarily stacked MLGs. Moreover, we find that an interplay of parallel and rhombohedral stackings allows for flat band engineering and enhancement in arbitrarily stacked MLGs. The existence of flat bands in MLGs might offer another interesting platform for exploring the superconductivity in graphene systems beyond the twisted bilayer graphene.

Under magnetic fields above 3T, TN splits into TN1 and TN2, which correspond to the transitions from the paramagnetic phase to the up-up-down (uud) phase and from the uud phase to the triangular coplanar phase, respectively. The NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a critical divergence at TN1, indicating the onset of long-range magnetic order. At TN2, the NMR-linewidth measured at 5.4 T exhibits an anomalous decrease, which we attribute to a change in the spin structure from the uud to the triangular coplanar phase.

- **TL;DR**: 通过多尺度原子模拟研究β-Ga2O3中重离子辐照产生的纳米离子径迹形成与恢复机制，揭示了电子能量损失(Se)和晶体取向对径迹形态的调控规律。

Swift heavy ion (SHI) irradiation generates nanoscale ion tracks through intense electronic excitation, yet the microscopic mechanisms governing their morphology and phase stability in low symmetry oxides remain poorly understood. Here, a multiscale atomistic simulation framework is employed to investigate SHI-induced track formation and recovery in monoclinic beta-Ga2O3 over a wide range of electronic energy losses (Se) and crystallographic orientations. A sequence of distinct structural responses is identified with increasing Se: complete lattice recovery at low Se, recrystallization into a metastable gamma-Ga2O3 phase at intermediate Se, and the formation of core-shell ion tracks at high Se, consisting of an amorphous core surrounded by a recrystallized gamma-phase shell. Despite the essentially isotropic initial energy deposition, the final ion-track morphology exhibits pronounced crystallographic anisotropy, governed by orientation-dependent recovery dynamics. The superior recrystallization along [010] direction is attributed to its exceptionally high elastic stiffness. Notably, SHI irradiation perpendicular to the (100) plane induces a more severe structural response at low Se (less than 10 keV/nm), however, at higher Se, it yields a smaller residual ion track compared with the other orientations. The simulated ion-track sizes show excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental measurements over a broad range of Se values. These findings establish a unified atomic-scale picture of core-shell track formation and anisotropic recovery in beta-Ga2O3.

Controlled disorder in correlated materials provides a new route to emergent stochastic dynamics in neuromorphic hardware. Here we show that focused ion beam irradiation in VO$_{2}$- and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$-based resistive-switching oscillators induces a transition from regular periodic oscillations to strongly irregular stochastic firing, while simultaneously reducing the required switching energy by orders of magnitude. Under an applied electric field, these materials undergo a volatile insulator-to-metal transition characterized by the formation of percolating metallic filaments within an insulating bulk. Using numerical simulations based on the Mott resistor network, we demonstrate that defect-induced modifications to filament nucleation and stability drive these devices into stochastic oscillatory regimes. These results are validated by experimental measurements on irradiated VO$_{2}$ and V$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices.

FeTe is a prototypical parent compound of iron-based superconductors. While bulk FeTe is non-superconducting with a long-range bicollinear antiferromagnetic order, superconductivity has been achieved in thin films. However, the approaches usually involve complex oxygen incorporation or interfacial effects, the microscopic mechanisms of which remain elusive. Here, we prepare high-purity, bare FeTe thin films on SrTiO3 and investigate their magnetic and superconducting states combining both microscopic and macroscopic characterizations. By reducing the interstitial Fe impurities, we successfully suppress the long-range antiferromagnetic order, enhance the quasiparticle coherence and induce superconductivity at ~10 K. Moreover, this process is readily reversible by tuning the Fe concentration. Our findings reveal that precise stoichiometric control is sufficient to induce intrinsic superconductivity in strained FeTe thin films. This work provides insights into the competition between magnetism and superconductivity in iron chalcogenides, and supplies a robust pathway for developing stable, high-purity superconducting FeTe films.

Aromatic $π$-stacking interactions play an important role in both natural and artificial systems, influencing processes such as charge separation in photosynthesis and charge transport in organic semiconductors. Controlling the geometry and distance between aromatic units is therefore crucial for tuning intermolecular interactions and charge-transfer efficiency. Due to their well-defined stacking geometry, paracyclophanes (PCPs) composed of two or more aromatic units connected by rigid linkers, provide an ideal platform for a systematic study of such effects. Despite extensive experimental studies of PCPs, a comprehensive and quantitatively validated theoretical description linking the structure with the electronic and optical properties is still missing. Here, we present an extensive computational and experimental investigation of the electronic and optical properties of homo-PCPs containing naphthalene diimide (NDI) or pyrene chromophores linked by bridges of varying length and rigidity. We introduce a robust methodology for an accurate simulation of the absorption and fluorescence spectra of PCPs based on a combined TD-DFT and CC2 approach, achieving excellent quantitative agreement with experiment. We also present and validate a fragment-based description of PCPs using the Frenkel exciton model. Such approach is valuable not only for interpretation of the electronic and optical properties of PCPs, but it can also significantly reduce the cost of the calculation while maintaining the accuracy of the supermolecular approach. This work establishes a quantitatively reliable framework linking structure, excitonic coupling, and charge-transfer interactions in PCPs with optical properties, providing design principles for next-generation optoelectronic materials.

Spontaneous dynamic systems have attracted significant attention for their rich underlying physics such as phase-locking and synchronization. In this work, we report a new mechanism of generating magnetic spontaneous oscillation via parametric pumping. By applying a pump tone to excite propagating spin waves in a yttrium iron garnet delay line, four-wave mixing converts the pump mode into two phase-autonomous propagating magnon modes, i.e. a spontaneous mode with nearly twice the wavenumber of the pump mode and an idler mode with nearly zero wavenumber. This allows us to reliably generate ultrasharp spin wave dynamics with broad frequency tunability from the pump and magnetic field. We show that the spontaneous mode can be phase-locked to a probe tone, similar to an auto-oscillator. Furthermore, the spontaneous dynamics can be used to implement a high-gain magnonic parametric amplifier with a gain up to 40 dB. Our results open a new avenue for studying nonlinear magnonics and synchronization physics in propagating magnon geometry and for developing new magnonic devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究展示了即使训练数据有限，只要数据集紧凑且基于物理相关量，机器学习模型仍能准确预测掺杂TiO₂单层的形成能，并实现化学可转移性。

Machine learning models are increasingly applied in materials science, yet their predictive power is often constrained by data scarcity. Here, we show that accurate predictions can be achieved, even with a limited number of training examples, provided the dataset is compact and and grounded in physically relevant quantities. By combining density functional theory calculations with a machine-learning framework, we construct accurate descriptor-based models to predict the formation energies of doped lepidocrocite TiO$_2$ monolayers. The predictive accuracy of machine-learning models was first evaluated for single-dopant Pt configurations, demonstrating that the selected structural and chemical descriptors reliably capture the key factors governing dopant stability. Chemical transferability is then examined by extending the dataset to include Ag-doped configurations. Predictive accuracy improved systematically as additional Ag-doped data points were included in the training, while the performance of Pt remains robust. These results highlight the potential of small and well-curated datasets combined with physically informed descriptors to enable not only accurate but also chemically transferable machine-learning-driven screening in doped TiO$_2$ monolayer.

### The Sokoban Random Walk: A Trapping Perspective

We study caging/trapping in Sokoban-type models, featuring a random walker moving through a disordered medium of obstacles and capable of pushing some obstacles blocking its path. In one-dimension, we allow the walker to push up to an arbitrary $N_{\rm P}$ number of obstacles. For $N_{\rm P}\gg 1$, we use large-deviation theory to show that the survival probability to remain uncaged exhibits crossover from an exponential decay with time at intermediate times to a stretched-exponential decay at long times, with an exponent $1/3$ independent of $N_{\rm P}$. The long-time exponent matches the Balagurov--Vaks--Donsker--Varadhan (BVDV) theory of the classical trapping problem, while the exponential decay is qualitatively distinct from the Rosenstock's intermediate-time theory for classical trapping. Similarly, in two dimensions, numerical simulations reveal that both the Sokoban model and its generalized version exhibit long-time stretched-exponential relaxation with exponent $1/2$, again consistent with the BVDV theory. Finally, in two dimensions, we find that the mean trap size is nonmonotonic in $ρ$: it is small at both low and high densities, but reaches a peak at a characteristic density $ρ_*$. We estimate $ρ_* \approx 0.55$ for the Sokoban model and $ρ_* \approx 0.675$ for the generalized Sokoban model.

- **TL;DR**: MLIP-MC框架用于评估通用机器学习原子间势在MOF气体吸附模拟中的表现，发现现有通用模型存在系统性偏差，需要针对MOF-吸附剂相互作用进行微调才能获得准确预测。

Grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations are essential for screening metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) for gas adsorption, yet their accuracy is limited by underlying interatomic potentials. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), trained on diverse chemical datasets, promise zero-shot prediction without system-specific training. We introduce MLIP-MC, an open-source Python framework to conduct GCMC simulations with MLIPs, and use this framework to benchmark a series of universal models, including MACE-MP-0, ORB-v3, and fairchem ODAC, for CO2 adsorption on ZIF-8, ZIF-4, and Mg-MOF-74. All universal models exhibit systematic biases, consistently over- or underestimating adsorption energetics. Crucially, accuracy depends on training data composition: only models trained on MOF-adsorbate interactions achieve reasonable agreement with a density functional theory derived reference. Errors grow linearly with CO2 uptake, reflecting compounding inaccuracies in adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Our results demonstrate that current universal MLIPs require finetuning for quantitative adsorption predictions and demonstrate the power of MLIP-MC to rapidly test models.

The understanding of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has been deeply guided by band topology and quantum geometry. Here, we introduce a real-space theoretical framework in which FCIs are understood in terms of composite bosons, local objects consisting of electrons bound to their energetically excluded surrounding orbitals. The central element of our framework is the construction of a radially ordered set of maximally localized basis for Chern bands without requiring continuous rotational symmetry. Within this basis, the complex many-body problem simplifies to a real-space organizing principle: a stable FCI occurs if the orbitals excluded around central electrons are those maximizing the two-body interaction energy. We validate this with direct numerical evidence for composite boson formation in the Haldane model, demonstrating that our criterion reliably characterizes FCIs. Importantly, our analysis illustrates that the composite boson framework bridges the fractional quantum Hall effect in continuum and lattice paradigms, providing a unified and intuitive real-space interpretation for distinct correlated phases. It thus establishes a foundation for diagnosing and guiding the design of both Abelian and non-Abelian topologically ordered phases across distinct platforms.

The interplay between conventional superconductivity and unconventional magnetism offers an exciting platform for realizing exotic superconducting phenomena. Here, we investigate Josephson effects in planar and vertical junctions based on CsV$_2$Te$_2$O-family materials, which host hidden $d$-wave altermagnetism with G-type antiferromagnetic order. In monolayer-based planar junctions, the quasi-1D, nearly flat, spin-polarized bands of the altermagnet, when coupled to $s$-wave superconductors, produce a \textit{fully} spin-polarized supercurrent with strong directional anisotropy -- a spin-selective Josephson effect. In multilayers, we uncover an \textit{altermagnetic even-odd effect}: spin-polarized supercurrents persist only in odd-layer planar junctions but cancel exactly in even layers. Thus, layer parity acts as a switch for spin-polarized supercurrent. In vertical junctions, odd-layer barriers enhance equal-spin triplet transport while even layers favor opposite-spin transport, yielding a robust period-two oscillation in the total supercurrent with layer number. These layer-parity-dependent responses represent a general even-odd effect in hidden altermagnets, applicable to diverse magnetic and transport phenomena.

Determining the structure and following the structural evolution of molecules undergoing chemical reactions is one of the key goals of ultrafast molecular physics and chemistry. Recently, Coulomb explosion imaging has emerged as a promising technique for imaging the evolving structure of individual molecules in the gas phase. However, its practical application for structure determination is hampered by the lack of suitable algorithms to directly retrieve the molecular structure from the measured fragment-ion momentum data. Here, we propose a scheme to solve the underlying inverse problem by employing neural networks to infer the initial atomic positions from the final ion momenta on an event-by-event basis. Using this scheme, we retrieve the structure of several polyhalomethane isomers from simulated Coulomb explosion imaging data with an average per-atom position error of approximately 0.1 atomic units, i.e., to within 5% of the typical bond lengths. This development paves the way for an automated structure retrieval from Coulomb explosion data one molecule at a time, making it ideally suitable for analyzing pump-probe experiments where several products are formed that need to be distinguished.

- **TL;DR**: 在无晶界的90纳米厚铜薄膜中，当通道宽度小于150纳米且温度低于85K时，实现了弹道输运，表现为负弯曲电阻

In ballistic transport, the movement of charged carriers is essentially unimpeded by scattering events. In this limit, microscopic parameters such as crystal momentum, spin and quantum phases are well conserved, allowing electrons to maintain their quantum coherence over longer distances. Nanoscale materials, like carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanowires, exhibit ballistic transport. However, their scalability in devices is significantly limited. While deposited metal films offer excellent scalability for nanodevices, achieving ballistic transport in these films poses a challenge due to their short electronic mean free path. Here, we investigated the electronic transport in cross-geometry devices fabricated with 90 nm-thick copper films without grain boundaries. We observed ballistic transport in devices with channel width smaller than 150 nm below 85 K by measuring negative bend resistance. Our findings would open the opportunity for probing intrinsic quantum properties of Cu, and for realizing scalable low-loss signal transmission and high-quality interconnects in semiconductor devices.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一个精确的多谷包络函数模型，用于描述现代Si/SiGe异质结构中的谷分裂现象，解决了传统局部包络函数理论在原子级尖锐界面下的物理不变量问题。

Valley splitting in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells is a central parameter for silicon spin qubits and is commonly described with envelope-function and effective-mass theories. These models provide a computationally efficient continuum description and have been shown to agree well with atomistic approaches when the confinement potential is slowly varying on the lattice scale. In modern Si/SiGe heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and engineered Ge concentration profiles, however, the slowly varying potential approximation underlying conventional (local) envelope-function theory is challenged. We formulate an exact multi-valley envelope-function model by combining Burt-Foreman-type envelope-function theory, which does not rely on the assumption of a slowly varying potential, with a valley-sector decomposition of the Brillouin zone. This construction enforces band-limited envelopes, which satisfy a set of coupled integro-differential equations with a non-local potential energy operator. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we derive the intervalley coupling matrix element within this non-local model and prove that it is strictly invariant under global shifts of the confinement potential (choice of reference energy). We then show that the conventional local envelope model generically violates this invariance due to spectral leakage between valley sectors, leading to an unphysical energy-reference dependence of the intervalley coupling. The resulting ambiguity is quantified by numerical simulations of various engineered Si/SiGe heterostructures. Finally, we propose a simple spectrally filtered local approximation that restores the energy-reference invariance exactly and provides a good approximation to the exact non-local theory.

In this work, we report the development of a rubidium-based single-beam scalar optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) and demonstrate its application in measuring human cardiac magnetic fields in an unshielded environment. The developed magnetometers exhibit a noise floor below 15 pT/sqrt(Hz) in the frequency range of 1 to 35 Hz, with a measurement bandwidth of 100 Hz. When operated in a gradiometric configuration, the noise floor is further reduced to below 3 pT/sqrt(Hz) over the same frequency range. Magnetocardiography (MCG) signals were recorded at five different locations across the thorax. A clear polarity reversal of the QRS complex was observed across these measurement positions, confirming the spatial sensitivity of the system. The proposed system shows strong potential for clinical diagnostics, offering valuable physiological information through non-contact MCG measurements

### Relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets

The relativistic spin-momentum locking has been proven in time-reversal-breaking classes of materials with zero net magnetization in the non-relativistic limit, such as altermagnets and other non-collinear magnets. Using density functional theory calculations, we aim to show relativistic spin-momentum locking in ferromagnets, focusing on a broad class of ferromagnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry, and compare with fcc Ni. In SrRuO3, the antisymmetric exchange interaction produces a spin canting orthogonal to the easy axis, while in all other cases, spin canting is forbidden. Even when the canted magnetic moment in real space is forbidden, relativistic spin-momentum locking shows sizable contributions in k-space. Using prototypical ferromagnets such as orthorhombic SrRuO3, hexagonal CrTe and CrAs with the NiAs crystal structure, half-Heusler MnPtSb, and fcc Ni, we demonstrate that relativistic spin-momentum locking can generate strong effects in ferromagnets. Subdominant components of centrosymmetric ferro-magnetic materials with magnetic sites connected by rotational symmetry host spin-momentum locking similar to altermagnets, while noncentrosymmetric MnPtSb hosts relativistic p-wave due to the spin-orbit coupling. Fcc Ni shows a more complex behavior with a combination of two spin-momentum locking patterns characteristic of altermagnets. Because ferromagnets typically have larger bandwidths than altermagnets, they provide a promising platform for observing even-wave relativistic spin-momentum locking and associated emergent phenomena. From an application standpoint, relativistic spin-momentum locking governs symmetry-allowed spin Hall currents, spin photocurrents, and other momentum-dependent spin responses in k-space.

Using quantum distance, magnetic susceptibility in the non-interacting limit can be rigorously split into two contributions: one arising solely from band dispersion, while the other stems from quantum geometric contributions. In this Letter, we apply this decomposition to two materials, LaFeAsO and Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O, and demonstrate that their dominant magnetic fluctuations originate from the geometric contribution. In LaFeAsO, stripe-type antiferromagnetic fluctuations arise primarily from quantum geometry, while in Pb$_9$Cu(PO$_4$)$_6$O the geometric term suppresses antiferromagnetic fluctuations and stabilizes ferromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings highlight the essential role of quantum geometry in governing magnetic fluctuations in multi-band systems, and provide a unique and quantitative framework to disentangle band-structure and wavefunction-geometry effects that have often been discussed collectively as multi-orbital effects.

We propose a theoretical model for a superconductor that exhibits the reentrant superconductivity in Zeeman fields. The Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian includes three vectors in spin space: a $d$ vector of a spin-triplet superconducting state, a potential representing spin-orbit interactions, and a Zeeman field. When the three vectors are perpendicular to one another, the spin-orbit interaction suppresses superconductivity in weak Zeeman fields and enhances superconductivity in strong Zeeman fields. The instability (stability) of superconducting state is characterized by the appearance of odd-frequency (even-frequency) Cooper pairs.

Coarse-grained molecular dynamics often sacrifices accuracy and transferability for computational efficiency, but the use of machine learned potentials is helping coarse-grained models attain performance on par with atomistic molecular dynamics. Nevertheless, developing representations of the coarse-grained potential energy surface faces severe scaling challenges due to the extreme data demands of widely used "bottom-up" coarse-graining objectives. In this work, we show that mean force matching, a strategy for training thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained models, requires 50x fewer training samples and 87% less total atomistic simulation time, while obtaining better accuracy on the potential of mean force for unseen proteins compared to other commonly used objectives. By systematically removing noise from the objective function, we demonstrate that it is possible to scale machine learning architectures for coarse-graining, enabling highly accurate and transferable models. We show the advantages of mean force matching both theoretically and through exhaustive benchmarking using thermodynamic consistency as the primary metric of accuracy.

- **TL;DR**: 强无序磁矩耦合到陈绝缘体中产生无法连续连接到清洁极限的拓扑相，这些是真正的无序驱动拓扑相

Strong directional disorder in local magnetic moments coupled to a Chern insulator gives rise to topological phases that cannot be continuously connected to the clean limit and are therefore genuinely disorder-driven. We demonstrate this in a spinful Qi-Wu-Zhang model of a two-dimensional Chern insulator coupled to disordered classical spins of unit length. The topological phase diagram is computed numerically using two complementary approaches: twisted boundary conditions and the topological Hamiltonian technique. Our results show that strong disorder can act as a fundamental topological mechanism rather than merely a perturbation. For strong exchange coupling, tuning the mass parameter reveals a transition between phases with different Chern numbers $C$. Remarkably, this transition is driven by zeros, rather than poles, of the disorder-averaged Green's function crossing the chemical potential, and has no analogue in any clean system. We further identify a strong-coupling phase with $C = 0$ that is nonetheless topologically nontrivial, characterized by a distinct Chern number $C^{(\mathrm{S})} \neq 0$ over the manifold of classical spin configurations. This phase is also disorder-driven, as $C^{(\mathrm{S})} = 0$ in the clean limit.

- **TL;DR**: 开发了针对过渡金属表面吸附分子设计的密度泛函近似新框架，实现了过渡金属化学精度（13 kJ/mol），解决了现有DFA的定性失败问题。

Density functional theory (DFT) has been critical towards our current atomistic understanding of catalysis on transition-metal surfaces. It has opened new paradigms in rational catalyst design, predicting fundamental properties, like the adsorption energy and reaction barriers, linked to catalytic performance. However, such applications depend sensitively on the predictive accuracy of DFT and achieving experimental-level reliability, so-called transition-metal chemical accuracy (13 kJ/mol), remains challenging for present density functional approximations (DFAs) or even methods beyond DFT. We introduce a new framework for designing DFAs tailored towards studying molecules adsorbed on transition-metal surfaces, building upon recent developments in non-self-consistent DFAs. We propose two functionals within this framework, demonstrating that transition-metal chemical accuracy can be achieved across a diverse set of 39 adsorption reactions while delivering consistent performance for 17 barrier heights. Moreover, we show that these non-self-consistent DFAs address qualitative failures that challenge current self-consistent DFAs, such as CO adsorption on Pt(111) and graphene on Ni(111). The resulting functionals are computationally practical and compatible with existing DFT codes, with scripts and workflows provided to use them. Looking ahead, this framework establishes a path toward developing more accurate and sophisticated DFAs for computational heterogeneous catalysis and beyond.

One of the longstanding open questions in linear response theory concerns its true range of validity. Determining when the linear approximation can be trusted typically requires knowledge of second-order corrections, which are often difficult to compute explicitly. In this letter, I propose a self-consistent criterion for the validity of linear response, formulated in terms of a typical length scale that emerges from the fluctuation-response inequality within the theory itself. The result applies to classical open systems. I illustrate the criterion with explicit examples of Brownian particles in harmonic traps, and classical open systems presenting Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Finally, I discuss the physical meaning of this typical length, providing both thermodynamic and information-theoretic interpretations.

We present a comprehensive investigation of the effects of Fe doping on the lattice dynamics, magnetic ordering, and magneto-transport properties of the intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets Co1-xFexNb3S6 (x = 0.1 and 0.3). Temperature- and polarization-dependent Raman scattering measurements reveal a pronounced blue shift of the 180 cm-1 phonon mode with increasing Fe concentration, indicating enhanced sensitivity of lattice vibrations to Fe-induced structural and mass effects. While the temperature evolution of the phonon modes is dominated by conventional anharmonic phonon softening, subtle anomalies observed near the Néel temperature for x = 0.1 point to weak spin-phonon coupling. Electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility data show clear signatures of the antiferromagnetic phase transitions at TN ~ 20.5-23.7 K for x = 0.1 and TN ~ 32.0 K for x = 0.3. Out-of-plane magnetization measurements reveal hysteretic behavior with two field-induced transitions for x =0.1, which evolve into a single hysteresis loop at x =0.3, signaling a subtle reconstruction of the magnetic ground state. Magneto-transport measurements for x = 0.1 further display a butterfly-shaped hysteretic magnetoresistance and a weak topological Hall effect; however, both features are strongly suppressed at x = 0.3. These results illustrate the critical role of Fe-induced magnetic structure reconstruction in fine-tuning topological and magnetic transport phenomena in intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnets.

Inelastic neutron scattering experiments with a large set of comounted Na$_2$IrO$_3$ crystals reveal the low-energy magnon dispersion in this candidate material for Kitaev physics. The magnon gap amounts to 1.7(1) meV and can be interpreted similarly to the sister compound $α$-RuCl$_{3}$ to stem from the zone boundaries in the antiferromagnetic zigzag structure. The neutron experiments find no evidence for low-energy excitations with ferromagnetic character, which contrasts to the findings in $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Our results are consistent with a recently proposed microscopic model that involves an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg nearest-neighbor exchange in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ in contrast to the ferromagnetic one considered for $α$-RuCl$_{3}$. Although the magnetic response shows the signatures of bond-directional anisotropy in both materials the different relative signs of Kitaev and Heisenberg interaction result in different deviations from the initial Kitaev model. Low-energy ferromagnetic fluctuations cannot be considered as a fingerprint of ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction.

This work presents the development and testing of a novel radio-frequency (RF) gasket with a Lenz lens surface geometry for contactless measurements in diamond anvil cells (DACs). Conventional RF approaches, which fabricate the Lenz lens onto the diamond anvil itself, preclude the placement of electrical circuits. Our method overcomes this limitation by transferring the RF sensor to a composite Ta-based gasket. The sensor consists of single-turn microcoils that are formed by magnetron sputtering a gold film onto an insulating Ta$_2$O$_5$ layer. The Lenz lens topology is then patterned using focused ion beam etching. We validated this technique using polycrystalline Cu1234 and Bi2212 high-$\textit{T$_c$}$ superconductors at ambient and high pressures. The measurements consistently identified the superconducting transition temperature across carrier frequencies from 111 kHz to 200 MHz. This new gasket technique establishes a reliable and sensitive tool for contactless studies of superconductivity under high pressure.

The increased complexity and reduced size of (opto-)electronic devices demands for quantitative descriptions of excess carrier transport and recombination via various mechanisms. In addition, experimental methods capable of resolving carrier dynamics on the nanometer scale are required. In this paper, we present a quantitative model of a confined geometry including recombination at two surfaces, which is very generic for electron beam induced current measurements in a scanning transmission electron microscope - a method which offers atomic scale spatial resolution. The model is based on analytical considerations as well as finite element simulations and underlying assumptions are subjected to an in-depth discussion. Finally, the successfull application to experimental data obtained on the complex oxide SrTi0.995Nb0.005O3 demonstrates the practicality and robustness of the approach, which enables the precise determination of its bulk diffusion length of L = 10.2 +- 0.1 nm.

A thermal analogue of the classical brachistochrone problem, which minimizes the connection time between two equilibrium states of harmonically confined Brownian particles, has recently been solved theoretically. Here we report its experimental realization using two optically trapped microparticles subjected to a bang-bang effective temperature protocol. Despite their distinct relaxation times, both degrees of freedom are steered to their respective equilibrium states simultaneously in a finite minimal time. We provide a complete time-resolved characterization of the nonequilibrium dynamics through the evolution of the position variances and the entropy production within the framework of stochastic thermodynamics, enabling a quantitative comparison with direct relaxation and a suboptimal protocol. In addition, we employ information-geometric tools -- recently referred to as thermal kinematics -- to track the system's path in state space with a single dynamical quantity. Our results show that faster equilibration requires a larger entropy production and an increased thermodynamic length, revealing a direct trade-off between temporal optimality and thermodynamic cost in multidimensional stochastic systems driven by a single intensive control parameter.

- **TL;DR**: 利用阿秒瞬态吸收光谱研究立方SnS中载流子注入、冷却和复合的超快动力学，揭示了载流子密度依赖的机制转变。

Metastable cubic tin(II) sulfide ($π$-SnS) is an earth-abundant semiconductor whose three-dimensionally bonded chiral lattice may overcome the short minority-carrier lifetime of orthorhombic SnS while maintaining a near-ideal bandgap for tandem photovoltaics. Despite its promise, ultrafast carrier cooling and recombination mechanisms over illumination density remain poorly constrained. We use core-level extreme-ultraviolet attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy at the Sn $4d$ edge to track carrier injection, cooling, and recombination in $π$-SnS with element- and orbital-specific sensitivity. Following femtosecond near-infrared excitation, the Sn $4d\rightarrow$CB onset exhibits conduction-band state filling and a carrier-induced edge shift, enabling extraction of density-dependent kinetics. The transient response follows a biexponential decay with a fast hot-carrier cooling component and a slower recombination component. At low carrier densities, recombination is consistent with interface-limited processes, whereas above $\sim1\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ both cooling and recombination accelerate, indicating a crossover to carrier-carrier interaction-dominated dynamics. Coherent phonon oscillations with a period of $\sim188$ fs reveal coupling between electronic excitation and lattice motion. These results provide a comprehensive picture of nonequilibrium carrier and phonon dynamics in cubic SnS, reveal a change of mechanisms over a range of carrier densities, and establish the value of using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study ultrafast processes in complex semiconductors that have optoelectronic and energy-conversion applications.

Nonequilibrium many-body physics is one of the core problems in modern physics, while the dynamical scaling from a gapless phase to the critical point is a most important challenge with very few knowledge so far. In the driven dynamics with a tuning rate $R$ across the quantum critical point (QCP) of a system with size $L$, the finite-time scaling shows that the square of the order parameter $m^2$ obeys a simple scaling relation $m^2\propto R^{2β/νr}$ in the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$. Here, by studying the driven critical dynamics from a gapless ordered phase in the bilayer Heisenberg model, we unveil that the approaches to the scaling region dominated by the KZ scaling limit with $RL^r\gg1$ are {\it non-commutative}: this scaling region is inaccessible for large $R$ and finite medium $L$, while merely accessible for large $L$ and moderately finite $R$. We attribute this to the memory effect induced by the finite-size correction in the gapless ordered phase. This non-commutative property makes $m^2$ still strongly depends on the system size and deviates from $m^2\propto R^{2β/νr}$ even for large $R$. We further show that a similar correction applies to the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics. Our results establish an essential extension of nonequilibrium scaling theory with a gapless ordered initial state.

The frequency-dependent complex optical conductivity reflects key properties of superconductors, such as the energy gap in the density of states (DOS) and the superfluid density. For disordered superconductors, the optical conductivity often can be described within Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, while in corresponding tunneling experiments, deviations in the observed DOS typically require modelling by the phenomenological Dynes formula. The implications of such Dynes DOS for optics were rarely discussed so far. Here we probe the terahertz conductivity of superconducting NbN thin films with thicknesses ranging from 4.5 to 20nm, which were grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our frequency range from 0.3 to 2.1 THz covers energies below and above the spectral gap. For 20nm thick NbN, we find in the optical conductivity distinct deviations from the BCS model, including a step-like characteristic in the absorption at half the zero-temperature spectral gap. These observations can be fully captured by Dynes electrodynamics with a small and temperature-independent pair-breaking rate. For the other films, we also observe signs of Dynes electrodynamics, and we discuss the evolution of the energy gap, the superfluid density, and the pair-breaking rate as function of film thickness.

- **TL;DR**: DMTS-NC是一种使用非保守力的蒸馏多时间步策略，通过双级RESPA形式耦合精确保守势与简化的蒸馏表示，可加速原子分子动力学模拟15-30%，无需微调且更稳定。

Following our previous work (J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the "holes" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential.

Unidirectional magnetoresistance, or electric magnetochiral anisotropy (eMChA), is a nonlinear magnetotransport phenomenon that arises in noncentrosymmetric conductors , where changes in resistance $R(B)$ are: (i) chiral, $ΔR(B)/R(0)=2\,χ\, {\bf I}\cdot{\bf B}$, or (ii) polar, $ΔR(B)/R(0)=2\,γ\, {\bf I}\cdot({\bf P}\times{\bf B})$, with eMChA coefficients $χ$ and $γ$. In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 106602 (2025)], we showed that the eMChA in the conduction band of tellurene is polar ($χ=0$, $γ\neq 0$) and emerges from the quantum metric dipole due to its Weyl node and from the lone pair polarization ${\bf P}$. Here, we extend our work to the valence band of tellurene, where the eMChA is usually said to be chiral ($χ\neq 0, γ= 0$). We show that also a polar coefficient $γ\neq 0$ emerges naturally through a downfolding procedure, in which remote Weyl-node containing bands induce momentum-space gradients of the quantum metric in the low-energy levels, activating finite metric dipoles. Combining semiclassical Boltzmann transport with a ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ description of tellurene, our numerical calculations agree quantitatively with doping ($μ$) dependent second-harmonic measurements of the longitudinal voltage $V^{2ω}_\parallel(μ)$ in perpendicular field. The combined chiral and polar characters ($χ\neq0, γ\neq 0)$ of the eMChA in tellurene also explains the shift in the angular ($φ$) dependence of $V^{2ω}_\parallel(φ)$ for in plane fields. Our results demonstrate that the polar eMChA can arise in topologically trivial bands through multiband effects and establishes tellurene as a platform for quantum-geometric rectification in both electron and hole regimes.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了通过单轴应变控制Ca2RuO4中的反铁磁基态和太赫兹磁振子激发，在应变诱导的相变附近实现了超过10%的磁振子能量调控。

Antiferromagnets typically host spin-wave (magnon) excitations in the terahertz (THz) regime, offering a promising platform for high-speed magnonic information technologies. Harnessing these excitations requires sensitive control of their spectral properties. Here we use resonant x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering to demonstrate uniaxial-strain control of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and THz magnon excitations in the layered Mott insulator Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Although the states separated by the strain-induced phase transition differ only by the sign of the weak and partially frustrated interlayer interaction, their magnon energies differ by more than 10% (~ 0.3 THz). Our theoretical analysis explains this surprising observation by tracing the origin of both the sign reversal of the interlayer coupling and the magnon energy to the spin-orbital composition of the Ru valence electrons. The extreme strain sensitivity of the THz magnon energy near a magnetic phase transition opens up pathways towards a new generation of transition-edge magnonic devices.

We report the discovery of a new compound, Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$, and reveal the hidden time-reversal-like degenerate states within it. Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ is an antiferromagnet with the distorted kagome lattice of Ce atoms, in which several fractional magnetization plateaus emerge with the increase of magnetic field. At the 1/2 magnetization plateau, obvious hysteresis has been observed in the magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity during the rise and fall of the magnetic field. However, hysteresis vanishes in the corresponding measurements of magnetization, indicating the existence of degenerate states with the same net magnetization but different electronic transport properties. The degenerate states can be connected by the time-reversal-like operation. In addition, by comparing with HoAgGe, it is suggested that the special crystal structure in Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ may have a shielding effect on the time-reversal-like operation, thereby affecting the distinction of degenerate states. Our work establishes Ce$_3$MgBi$_5$ as an example of utilizing electronic transport properties to identify and distinguish hidden symmetries in frustrated magnetic systems.

In the M-phase the large correlation charge gap strongly suppresses the critical current, while the S-phase behaves as a $0$-junction, with a proximitized gap that closes for $φ=π$ to yield a correlated metal. Phase bias and junction transparency can thus serve as tuning knobs to switch between conducting and insulating regimes. Working within the dynamical mean field theory using the numerical renormalization group as the impurity solver, we associate M- and S-phase solutions with the doublet and singlet fixed points of the underlying superconducting Anderson impurity problem. We obtain detailed insight into the spectral structure on all energy scales. In the M-phase, the self-energy has sub-gap resonances symmetrically located around the Fermi level resulting from the splitting of the ''mid-gap pole'' found in Mott insulators; this structure accounts for phase insensitivity.

In quantum-kinetic approaches to the dynamics of Coulomb-bound many-body correlations such as excitons, trions, biexcitons or higher-order correlations, a detailed knowledge of the many-body Coulomb Hamiltonian serving as a starting point is important. In this manuscript, the second-quantized description of the Coulomb interaction between Bloch electrons in a Heisenberg-equation-of-motion approach in atomically thin semiconductors is derived and reviewed. Emphasis is put on a discussion of Umklapp processes and the dielectric screening including all local-field effects. A link between \textit{ab initio} methods of screening and few-band models in effective-mass approximations for the quantum kinetics is established and all important Coulomb scattering processes contributing to the exciton energy landscape and density-independent exciton scattering are discussed.

The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt\% and 50 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the \textbf{M}ulti-binding \textbf{S}ites \textbf{U}nited in \textbf{C}ovalent-\textbf{O}rganic \textbf{F}ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (\ce{FeCp2}) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt\% and 72.6 g \ce{H2} L$^{-1}$ at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15--20 kJ$\cdot$mol$^{-1}$) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.

Polycrystalline hafnia-based thin films exhibit mixed ferroelectric (FE), antiferroelectric (AFE), and dielectric (DE) behavior, with switching characteristics strongly influenced by microstructure and phase distribution. Here, we develop a unified grain-resolved three-dimensional phase-field framework for metal-insulator-metal capacitors that simultaneously captures ferroic phase characteristics in realistic polycrystalline microstructures by explicitly incorporating grain topology and crystallographic orientation. Antipolar sublattice kinetics are represented via the coupled evolution of macroscopic and staggered polarization order parameters. All thermodynamic and kinetic parameters are calibrated to experimental P-E hysteresis loops and held fixed across all simulations. The results show that phase fractions primarily determine hysteresis character, while vertical segregation of AFE- and FE-rich regions systematically reduces the effective coercive field (Ec) under identical electrical loading. Grain-resolved analysis reveals that this reduction arises from microstructure-assisted switching pathways and electrostatic coupling between layers. These findings demonstrate that vertical phase arrangement provides a viable strategy to engineer switching behavior in hafnia-based ferroic capacitors and highlight the importance of explicit microstructural resolution for quantitative phase-field modeling.

Quantum circuits have been shown to be a fertile ground for realizing long-range entangled phases of matter. While various quantum double models with non-chiral topological order have been theoretically investigated and experimentally implemented, the realization and characterization of chiral topological phases have remained less explored. Here we show that chiral topological phases in spin systems, i.e., chiral spin liquids, can be prepared in quantum circuits using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) framework. On top of the VQE ground state, signatures of the chiral topological order are revealed using the recently proposed tangent space excitation ansatz for quantum circuits. We show that, both topological ground state degeneracy and the chiral edge mode can be faithfully captured by this approach. We demonstrate our approach using the Kitaev honeycomb model, finding excellent agreement of low-energy excitation spectrum on quantum circuits with exact solution in all topological sectors. Further applying this approach to a non-exactly solvable chiral spin liquid model on square lattice, the results suggest this approach works well even when the topological sectors are not exactly known.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究使用原子计算参数化的离域动力学蒙特卡洛方法，揭示了Y6等非富勒烯受体高效电荷分离的机制，发现离域效应能解释其高迁移率和电荷生成效率。

Non-fullerene acceptors (NFA), such as Y6, have significantly improved the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). However, the fundamental processes behind the high efficiencies of NFA devices have remained incompletely understood, with the high efficiencies persisting without the large energetic offsets often thought to be required for charge separation. Even more surprising has been the efficient charge generation in neat Y6 devices, where there is no energetic offset at all. Here, we simulate charge transport and separation in Y6 using delocalised kinetic Monte Carlo (dKMC) parameterised using atomistic calculations, thus taking into account the often-neglected ingredients of delocalisation, disorder, and polaron formation. Including delocalisation predicts higher carrier mobilities and exciton diffusion coefficients than is possible with classical simulations, bringing them into agreement with experimental values. Delocalisation also predicts higher charge-generation efficiencies in neat Y6, in agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, this work establishes dKMC as a realistic, predictive tool for understanding next-generation OPVs.

- **TL;DR**: 通过离子注入增强成核外延技术，在AlN-SiC界面实现了约800 MW/m2-K的超高热边界电导，这是半导体界面中报道的最高值之一。

Overheating is a critical bottleneck limiting the performance and reliability of next-generation high-power and high-frequency electronics. Interfacial thermal resistance constitutes a significant portion of the total thermal resistance. In this study, we report an ultrahigh thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of approximately 800 MW/m2-K at the atomically-sharp AlN-SiC interface, achieved through an ion implantation-enhanced nucleation epitaxy technique. This value is among the highest TBC values reported for semiconductor interfaces, confirmed by structural characterizations which show an ultrahigh-quality interface. Atomistic Green Function calculations reveal that elastic phonon transmission dominates the interface, with nearly half of the acoustic modes (0-15 THz) exhibiting near-unity transmission due to the atomically sharp structure. Furthermore, using high-energy-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy, we probe vibrational properties with nanometer spatial resolution and identify unique interfacial phonon modes connecting the mismatched phonon spectra, confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. The ultrahigh TBC is attributed to both the high elastic phonon transmission due to the high quality interfaces and the inelastic phonon scattering channel due to interfacial phonon modes. These findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of interfacial thermal transport but also provide a pathway for effective thermal management in emerging electronic devices.

We demonstrate a non-volatile magnetoelectric magnonic memory (MEMM) that enables fully electrical write/read via direct magnon-driven sensing in an insulating antiferromagnet. A fabricated SrIrO3/La-BiFeO3/SrIrO3 trilayer exhibits sub-100 ps switching, a remnant polarization of 20 uC/cm2, and a readout voltage contrast close to 1mV between high and low-resistance states. To connect device physics to circuit behavior, we develop and experimentally validate a compact circuit model that captures spin Hall injection and spin transport. Simulations with optimized material parameters predict output voltages &gt; 100mV, enabling cascading without external amplification. Using this framework, we design MEMM-based memory and logic blocks, including a 1T1R array, two inverter implementations (complementary two-device and single-device), and a three-input majority gate, and evaluate deep-pipelined operation. The model projects switching energies down to 1 aJ per operation and logic propagation delays of 30-60 ps, indicating MEMM as a promising platform for energy-constrained, high throughput computing.

- **TL;DR**: 冰的相位衬度TEM中观察到的蜂窝状图案通常源于本征基面堆垛层错，而非单晶中的单个氧柱排列。该研究实现了89皮米的线分辨率，揭示了冰相结构缺陷的容忍度。

Phase-contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of hexagonal ice (Ih) along [0001] sometimes shows a honeycomb-like pattern, often interpreted as individual oxygen columns in single crystals. Here, we show that this pattern commonly arises from intrinsic basal stacking faults instead. A translational boundary separating domains of comparable thickness, with an in-plane offset of (2/3a + 1/3b), produces this honeycomb-like contrast. Stacking domains translated in nonequivalent directions yields patterns resembling cubic ice (Ic) along [0001] but with a 3-fold symmetry. We imaged this structure at a record-breaking line resolution of 89 picometers, finer than the O-H covalent bond length. These findings highlight the defect tolerance of ice's molecular packing and clarify the structural relationships among hexagonal, stacking-disordered, and cubic ice phases. This resolution milestone opens new avenues for characterizing subtle structural perturbations of water in the solid state.

This paper considers the propagation of excitons in linear chains of QDs with a side defect, located on a dielectric substrate. This configuration is suitable for spatially selective excitation of the system by pulsed optical radiation through the side defect. The dynamics of excitation in the chain is governed by structural disorder, caused by technological variations in the parameters of the QDs themselves and their mutual arrangement. To describe the quantum properties of excitons in the QD chain, a model Hamiltonian is used, taking into account the coupling of neighboring QDs due to dipole-dipole interaction. The localization of stationary states is calculated depending on the magnitude of disorder and the chain length. A criterion is introduced that determines the boundaries of the phase transition from the localized to the delocalized excitation phase. The dynamics of exciton transfer along the QD chain is calculated depending on its length and degree of disorder for linear excitation of the system by a laser pulse. It is shown that dynamic localization emerging in the system corresponds to the stationary localization properties of the states of the chain with a side defect.

We used a multiscale model to study the damage caused by swift heavy ions in GaN. The model combines Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the material response to the excitation initiated by a projectile. We found that the most appropriate simulation approach couples the dynamical screening of charges of target atoms during the scattering of fast electrons with the Tersoff-Brenner interatomic potential describing atomic dynamics in the excited target. The simulations demonstrate the formation of damaged ion tracks with an amorphous core, containing voids filled with nitrogen. The core is surrounded by a damaged crystalline region containing edge dislocations, consistent with experimental observations.

In the intermetallid rare-earth tetragonal EuAl4 system, competing itinerant exchange mechanisms lead to a complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring a centrosymmetric skyrmion lattice. Previous inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS) experiments revealed that the incommensurate charge-density wave (CDW) transition in EuAl4 (TCDW = 142 K) is driven by momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC). We present the results of IXS under high hydrostatic pressure induced by diaond anvils and show how the EPC in EuAl4 is renormalized and suppressed in the material's temperature-pressure phase diagram. Our findings highlight the crucial role of momentum-dependent EPC in the formation of the CDW in EuAl4 and provide further insights into how external pressure can be used to tune charge ordering in quantum materials.

The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond exists in different charge states with distinct photoluminescence properties, which are sensitive to the nanoscale electrochemical environment. Hence, the NV charge state is emerging as a powerful all-optical platform for nanoscale sensing and imaging. Although significant progress has been made in engineering near-surface NV centers in bulk diamond, controlling the NV charge state in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has proven challenging, limiting the sensitivity and reliability of FND-based charge state sensing. Here, we demonstrate reliable, reversible switching between the fluorescent NV$^0$ and non-fluorescent NV$^+$ charge states in sub-30 nm FNDs via surface oxidation and hydrogenation, respectively, for single particles and particle powder. In aqueous electrochemical cells, we demonstrate voltage and ion concentration imaging based on the NV charge state in self-assembled FND layers on transparent substrates. Applied voltages reliably modulate the FND PL with a sensitivity of up to 16 mV Hz$^{-1/2}$. Importantly, FND PL is also modulated by local changes in salt concentration with a sensitivity of up to 1.8% per millimolar NaCl, enabling all-optical imaging of ion concentration gradients at the microscale. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing fast, stable, and scalable nanoscale charge- and voltage-imaging technologies with sub-micrometer spatial resolution.

Previous studies of the $S=1/2$ triangular-lattice $J_1$--$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet have inferred the existence of a non-magnetic ground-state phase for an intermediate range of $J_2$, but disagree concerning whether it is a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL), a gapless (Dirac) QSL, or a weakly symmetry-broken phase. Using an improved dynamical density-matrix renormalization group method, we investigate the relevant intermediate $J_2$ regime for cylinders with circumferences from 6 to 9. Depending on the initial state and boundary conditions, we find two {\it distinct} variational states. The higher energy state is consistent with a Dirac QSL. In the lower-energy state, both the static and dynamical properties are qualitatively similar to the magnetically ordered state at $J_2=0$, suggestive of either a weakly magnetically ordered non-QSL or a gapped QSL proximate to a continuous transition to such an ordered state.

We propose a novel type of exceptional points, dubbed interaction-enabled $n$-fold exceptional points [EP$n$s ($n=2,3$)] -- EP$n$s protected by topology that are prohibited at the non-interacting level. Specifically, we demonstrate that both bosonic and fermionic systems host such interaction-enabled EP$n$s ($n=2,3$) in parameter space that are protected by charge U(1), pseudo-spin-parity, and $PT$ symmetries. The interaction-enabled EP2s are protected by zero-dimensional topology and give rise to qualitative changes in the loss rate, an experimentally measurable quantity for cold atoms. Furthermore, we reveal that interactions enable EP3s protected by one-dimensional topology beyond the point-gap topological classifications, suggesting the potential presence of a broader class of interaction-enabled non-Hermitian degeneracies.

Magnetic skyrmions in chiral magnets typically arrange into hexagonal lattices, with their structural order influenced by factors such as temperature, external magnetic fields and geometric constraints. While translational defects in skyrmion lattices such as dislocations have been extensively studied, individual angular defects, or disclinations, remain largely unexplored. Here, we report on the stabilization of five-fold and seven-fold disclinations in pentagon- and heptagon-shaped FeGe nanocrystals created using focused ion beam milling. The magnetic and elastic structures of the disclinated lattices are investigated using Fresnel imaging and off-axis electron holography in a transmission electron microscope. The results are supported by micromagnetic simulations and analytical models based on linear elasticity theory.

We investigate the nematic phase transition in the Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$-model on square and triangular lattices, accounting for finite lattice compressibility and bond-length-dependent magnetic exchange. Using Nematic Bond Theory, a diagrammatic self-consistent method, we study the nematostriction that happens when the onset of nematic order in the spin-system drives a concomitant structural phase transition. We analyze the mechanisms by which the magnetoelastic couplings renormalize the critical temperature and modify the phonon spectrum. The magnetoelastic feeback can also alter fundamentally the nature of the phase transition. Specifically, on the square lattice, the transition shifts from continuous to weakly first-order (discontinuous) beyond a critical magnetoelastic coupling threshold. Conversely, on the triangular lattice, the transition remains discontinuous regardless of coupling strength.

Controlling nonlinear effects in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical systems is essential for unlocking their full potential in sensing, signal processing, and frequency control. In this study, we develop a voltage-dependent Hamiltonian framework for a nanoelectromechanical resonator with two strongly coupled vibrational modes, representative of a nanostring platform. The mode frequencies and couplings of the system are tuned electrostatically using a DC voltage, which also controls the strength of the interactions. Our theoretical model reproduces the experimentally observed avoided crossing in the absence of an AC drive and generates tunable frequency-comb spectra when a parametric drive is applied. By scanning the DC voltage, we generate a phase diagram that links comb formation and sharp regime boundaries to underlying bifurcations, multi-stability, and attractor switching. Phase-resolved diagnostics based on a Kuramoto order parameter, together with autocorrelation and Poincaré analyses, quantify coherence and critical slowing down near these transitions. We further explore the relationship between nonlinear coupling, parametric excitation, and stability transitions within a single device of experimental relevance and establish a dynamical framework for engineering nanoelectromechanical resonators that offer enhanced tunability, functionality, and a predictive link to experimental outcomes.

Recent progress in porous carbon materials has highlighted the importance of structural design in controlling emergent physicochemical properties. In this context, hydrogen-substituted graphdiyne (HsGDY), a three-dimensional framework derived from graphdiyne (GDY), has recently emerged as a promising architecture whose stacking-dependent behavior remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and optical properties of HsGDY across distinct stacking sequences. Our results identify the AA and ABC configurations as the most energetically favorable, with AA corresponding to the global minimum, consistent with recent experimental observations. Electronic-structure analysis reveals that HsGDY is an indirect semiconductor with an electronic band gap of 0.89 eV (optB88-vdW), primarily governed by interlayer coupling and van der Waals interactions. The optical response exhibits pronounced absorption features spanning the visible to ultraviolet regions, highlighting strong potential for optoelectronic applications. \textit{Ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 700 K confirm the thermal robustness of the framework, with negligible structural distortions. Collectively, these findings elucidate the stacking-dependent stability and semiconducting character of HsGDY, providing a solid theoretical foundation for its integration into next-generation nanoelectronic and energy-harvesting technologies.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了莫尔量子材料中无外磁场量子霍尔态的理论框架，通过精确的局域SU(2)变换揭示了涌现的非阿贝尔规范场，并推导了斯格明子晶体有效场论。

Recent experiments in moiré quantum materials exhibit quantized Hall states without an external magnetic field, motivating continuum mechanisms based on smooth moiré-periodic pseudospin textures. We present a controlled theory of skyrmion Chern bands generated by such textures. An exact local $SU(2)$ transformation reveals an emergent non-Abelian gauge field; for large branch splitting we perform an operator-level Schrieffer-Wolff expansion, yielding a single-branch Hamiltonian together with systematically dressed physical operators that define the projected interacting theory beyond strict adiabaticity. The leading dynamics is governed by a $U(1)$ Berry connection whose flux is set by the skyrmion density, while controlled non-adiabatic corrections are fixed by the texture's real-space quantum geometric tensor. In a Landau-level representation built from the averaged emergent field, moiré-periodic modulations induce Umklapp-resolved deformations of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman kinematics and microscopic sources of excess optical quantum weight above the topological lower bound. Assuming a gapped Hall phase, we further derive a skyrmion-crystal effective field theory with a universal Berry-phase term and a noncommutative magnetophonon. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and rhombohedral graphene aligned with hexagonal boron nitride.

Propagation of short pulses through Cu$_2$O crystal containing Rydberg excitons is studied with the use of density matrix formalism and FDTD method. Saturation effects related to the so-called Rydberg blockade are studied extensively, exploring not only reduction of absorption (bleaching) but also power-dependent changes of the dispersive properties of the medium. The role of exciton lifetime and coherent population oscillations in the dynamics of the system is investigated. A pump-probe setup with two pulses is also studied, showing good agreement with recent experimental studies.

- **TL;DR**: 通过液晶相分散体制备的石墨烯氧化物纤维，相比非液晶相制备的纤维，具有显著增强的力学性能，这归因于更大的GO片尺寸和高度有序的排列。

Graphene oxide (GO) fibers are promising materials for lightweight, high-strength applications due to their unique structural tunability and mechanical performance. However, the properties of GO fibers strongly depend on the ordering of GO flakes during the assembly process. In this work, we demonstrate that GO fibers spun from a liquid crystalline (LC) GO dispersion exhibit significantly enhanced mechanical properties compared to those produced from non-LC GO dispersions. The improved tensile strength is attributed to the larger GO flake size and highly ordered alignment achieved in the LC phase. The LC-derived fibers demonstrated a Young's modulus of 12.3 GPa, a tensile strength of 146.8 MPa, and an elongation at break of 2.5%. These findings emphasize the critical role of flake size and LC ordering in enhancing the performance of GO-based fibers and suggest a straightforward pathway toward scalable fabrication of strong yet flexible carbon-based materials.

We propose a planar tunneling setup to probe vacancy-bound Majorana modes in the chiral Kitaev spin liquid. In this geometry, the inelastic tunneling conductance can be expressed directly in terms of real-space spin correlations, establishing a link between measurable spectra and the underlying fractionalized excitations. We show that spin vacancies host localized Majorana states that generate sharp near-zero-bias features, well separated from the continuum of bulk spin excitations. Compared to local STM measurements, the planar configuration naturally enhances the signal by coherently summing over multiple vacancies, reducing spatial resolution requirements. Our results demonstrate a realistic and scalable route to detect Majorana excitations in Kitaev materials.

Experiments at extreme strain rates and temperatures are critical for characterizing materials in high-speed applications. In this study, we develop a laser-driven particle impact platform capable of accelerating microparticles to supersonic velocities and impacting targets heated to temperatures approaching 2000 °C. The conventional laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) system has been modified to enable high-temperature experiments through the integration of a resistive heating system and the development of a robust launch pad assembly suitable for accelerating particles in high-temperature environments. To eliminate the oxidation of materials at elevated temperatures, an optically accessible portable vacuum chamber has been developed and integrated into the setup. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated through a study of the temperature dependent particle impact cratering behavior of POCO graphite. With this new platform, high-velocity, high-temperature impact experiments can be performed in a controlled environment, supporting the investigation of materials under extreme conditions.

We report the synthesis of an ilmenite-type polymorph of Ca$_x$IrO$_3$ distinct from the known post-perovskite and perovskite phases, via low-temperature topochemical Ca$^{2+}$/2Na$^+$ exchange from Na$_2$IrO$_3$. Powder X-ray diffraction is indexable in $R\bar{3}$, and whole pattern modelling that includes layer glide faults indicates that the selective broadening can be captured by a first order Markov stacking description based on stochastic switching between two symmetry equivalent lateral stacking steps, with explicit model dependence and an uncertainty of at least several percent. A freezing-like bulk magnetic anomaly is suggested at $T^* \sim 25$ K (defined by the onset of a ZFC/FC bifurcation at $μ_{0}H = 10$ mT), accompanied by a broad heat capacity feature and Curie-Weiss behavior with a large negative Weiss temperature of $θ_W \sim -98$ K. The effective moment $μ_{\rm eff} = 1.68 μ_{\rm B}$ per Ir is consistent with $J_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ for an Ir$^{4+}$. SEM-EDX suggests an A-site content below unity (Ca/Ir $&lt;$ 1); accordingly, we describe the ion-exchanged product using the nonstoichiometric formula Ca$_x$IrO$_3$. These results identify ilmenite-type CaIrO$_3$ as a honeycomb iridate in which stacking disorder can be quantified (with caveats regarding model and instrument correlations) and related to its low-temperature magnetic behavior.

Fuzzy sphere models conjecturally realize 3d CFTs in small systems of spinful fermions, but why they work so well is still not fully understood. Their Hamiltonians are built from electron density operators projected to the lowest Landau Level. We analyze the algebra of the density modes and verify that it satisfies the Jacobi identity. The fuzzy sphere geometry admits two thermodynamic limits: a local planar limit yielding the fuzzy plane, and a commutative limit yielding an ordinary sphere. In the planar limit, high-angular-momentum modes recover the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, whereas in the commutative limit the low-angular-momentum modes become semiclassical. We further find an explicit representation of the conformal algebra so(3,2) in the minimal two-electron system and extend it to larger systems via an so(3) equivariant coproduct. Because the coproduct splits one so(3) representation into a tensor product, it is structurally mismatched with the thermodynamic limit of critical fuzzy sphere Hamiltonians.

- **TL;DR**: 在晶格Weyl系统中，手征异常在强磁场下保持洛伦兹不变形式，提出旋转不变观测量ϰ作为异常的鲁棒特征，该量具有普适的B²依赖性和|cosΘ|标度行为。

The Adler-Bell-Jackiw chiral anomaly is shown to retain its Lorentz-invariant form, $\partial_μJ^μ_5 \propto \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, in lattice Weyl systems beyond moderate magnetic fields, where neither Lorentz nor rotational symmetry is present. We show that the longitudinal and Hall magnetoconductivities factorize into a product of a universal part, governed by the chiral anomaly, and a non-universal part that depends on the density of states at the Fermi level. A rotationally invariant observable $\varkappa = σ(c_V/T)^2$ is introduced as a robust signature of the anomaly, where $σ$ denotes the Euclidean norm of the longitudinal and Hall conductivities and $c_V$ is the specific heat density. This quantity follows a universal $B^2$ dependence and scales as $|\cosΘ|$, with $Θ$ being the angle between $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$. Through analytical derivation and full numerical simulation, we establish that $\varkappa$ remains universal independent of system parameters and of the orientation of the magnetic or electric field for fixed $Θ$. The emergent SO(3) symmetry in $\varkappa$ persists despite the absence of isotropy in both the microscopic model and the low-energy effective theory.

Strain engineering in semiconductor nanostructures offers a promising route to optimize electronic and optical properties for advanced quantum technologies. This study explores the relationship between core and shell thicknesses and strain distribution in Ge/Si core/shell nanowires, targeting their application as hosts for spin qubits. Nanowires were synthesized using an Au-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition technique, achieving control over core and shell dimensions. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and elemental mapping confirmed structural integrity, while Geometric Phase Analysis and Raman spectroscopy provided quantitative insights into strain variations driven by core and shell dimensions. Furthermore, polarization resolved $μ$-Raman measurements allowed us to quantify the longitudinal and transverse phonon mode splitting as a function of strain in the Ge core. The strain dependent electronic properties were investigated by hole mobility measurements. Finally, we observe a record high hole mobility of 25,500 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, underscoring the potential of these core/shell nanowire structures for the realization of high-fidelity spin qubits. Our findings highlight the critical role of geometry in strain tuning and provide valuable design guidelines for optimizing Ge/Si nanowires in scalable quantum device architectures.

Molecular and polymeric crystals show a wide range of functional properties that arise from the interplay between the atomic-scale structure of their constituent molecules and the organization of these molecules within the crystal lattice at macroscopic length scales. X-ray diffraction can provide structural information at these disparate length scales, but usually only through experiments that address one or the other of molecular (or unit-cell) structure versus crystal structure. Consequently, the accuracy of determined molecular or polymer structures may be limited by unaccounted crystal inhomogeneities of the crystal lattice and the characterization of crystalline materials might not reveal the underlying causes of crystal morphology. Here we introduce X-ray convergent-beam diffraction to obtain spatially-resolved structural information from crystals by projection topographic imaging. Using highly focusing X-ray multilayer Laue lenses, we show that Bragg reflections can be mapped into tomographic images of the crystal, for the characterization of strain and defects at high resolution. We demonstrate how the crystal morphology obtained this way can be accounted for when determining structure factors as a function of position in the crystal. The approach may assist in studies such as diffusion and binding in MOFS, protein-drug binding, crystal growth, and the mechanical responses of photo-reactive or thermally driven dynamic crystals.

Tunnel junctions are one of the key elements of chip-scale microsystems serving various technologies from classical microelectronics to quantum information. Aluminium and its oxide (AlOx) have dominated cryogenic tunnel junction technology for decades due to the high quality of AlOx barriers and Al superconducting properties below 1.2 K. However, many applications require non-superconducting junctions, either standalone or in combination with superconducting technology, motivating efforts to suppress Al superconductivity through magnetic fields, doping, or proximity effects -- approaches that so far suffered from integration compatibility and scalability issues. Here, we present a CMOS-compatible normal-metal tunnel junction technology based on TiW alloy and AlOx barriers. We demonstrate wafer-scale fabrication of TiW/Al-AlOx/TiW junctions and validate their performance in Coulomb blockade thermometers operating down to 20 mK, confirming robust normal-state behavior. This TiW-based architecture offers a scalable solution for non-superconducting tunnel junctions across a broad temperature range, enabling integration into advanced cryogenic, quantum and nanoelectronic chip-level systems.

Quantifying spin-orbital-to-charge conversion efficiency is crucial for spin-orbitronics. Two widely used methods for determining these efficiencies are based on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR), spin pumping FMR for the inverse effect, and spin-torque FMR for the direct effect. A key parameter to achieve accurate quantification, especially for spin-pumping FMR, is the RF field strength, $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$. We present a comprehensive theoretical model and experimental protocol that allow a correct quantification of $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$. It was validated by extensive experimental results and it was rigorously tested across various antennas geometries and ferromagnetic systems. We demonstrate that odd-symmetric Lorentzian voltages-which perfectly mimic spin-pumping or spin-torque FMR signals-can arise purely from rectification effects (due to anisotropic magnetoresistance) when $h_{\mathrm{RF}}$ orientation is parallel to the ferromagnetic surface. Through a systematic study of various 10-nm-thick ferromagnetic layers, such as Ni, NiFe, Fe, and CoFeB, we find that while Fe and CoFeB exhibit minimal rectification, Ni and NiFe generate strong rectified signals that must be corrected. We further demonstrate that these rectification effects become negligible for ferromagnetic thicknesses $\leq$ 6 nm, as validated in NiFe/Pt bilayers, providing an important guideline for the design of future heterostructures.

By utilizing the site-dependent spin quantization axis in semiconductor quantum dot (QD) arrays, shuttling-based spin qubit gates have become an appealing approach to realize scalable quantum computing due to the circumvention of using high-frequency driving fields. The emergence of a spin deviation from the local quantization axis of one residing QD is the prerequisite to implement the qubit gates. In this work, we study the non-adiabatic dynamics of a spin qubit shuttling between coupled QDs with inhomogeneous Landé g-tensors and a small magnetic field. The spin dynamics is analyzed through solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation of the qubit under the effects of spin-orbit interaction and rapid ramping inter-dot detuning. The precondition, imposed on the ramping time and the tunnel-coupling strength, to ensure a high-fidelity inter-dot transfer is estimated. We then calculate the change in the spin orientation of a transferred qubit, and study the dependences of the spin deviation on the difference in the quantization axes of the two QDs, the tunnel-coupling strength, and the ramping time. We also demonstrate that the effect of multiple rounds of inter-dot bidirectional shuttling can be captured by an operator matrix, and evaluate the idling times required for realizing the single-qubit Pauli-X and Pauli-Y gates. Intriguingly, it is confirmed that a generalized Hadamard gate can be achieved through tuning the idling times.

We report the fabrication and characterization of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass (Zr-BMG) clamp cell designed for high-pressure inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements. The INS spectra of the empty cell exhibit broad and featureless backgrounds, reflecting the amorphous structure of the Zr-BMG. Test measurements using a reference sample, CsFeCl$_{3}$, confirm that the neutron transmission of the Zr-BMG cell is significantly higher than that of a conventional monobloc CuBe clamp cell. These results demonstrate that the Zr-BMG clamp cell provides both enhanced neutron transparency and a clean background profile, thereby advancing high-pressure INS studies.

Two decades after its introduction, laser-assisted Atom Probe Tomography (La-APT) has demonstrated a unique potential for the study of the 3D distribution of atomic species in semiconductor materials and devices, and in a growing list of inorganic non-metallic solids. A crucial and often underestimated issue with APT is its accuracy in compositional measurements of non-metallic systems. This work introduces the principles of APT as an experimental technique, recalling the aspects potentially leading to compositional biases and underlining in particular the role of the surface electric field in governing the different physical-chemical phenomena that enable the measurement. It reviews the possible mechanisms of specific losses, as well as the methods for assessing a compositional bias and proposing possible correction methods. Finally, it establishes a state of the art on compositional biases in APT of non-metallic materials, on the basis of which it will be possible to conclude on specific recommendations for best practices, and the perspective of application of APT to new materials.

Floquet control of band topology is a central theme in ultrafast quantum materials science. Established experimental probes of light-induced topological states include ultrafast transport and time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, each with important strengths but also well-known limitations. Here we propose ultrafast terahertz scanning tunneling microscopy (THz-STM) as a real space energy-resolved probe of Floquet physics. We show that THz-STM enables direct local detection of bulk Floquet gaps and distinct Floquet edge state signatures. We derive a nonequilibrium Green's-function formalism for time-dependent tunneling that directly extends standard STM theory and provides an intuitive interpretation of rectified ultrafast tunneling currents. We apply the approach to bulk graphene and graphene nanoribbons of variable width. For the bulk, we show that THz-STM provides direct spectroscopic access to Floquet-induced gap openings, and we contrast pulsed pump-probe protocols with the continuous-wave Floquet steady-state limit. For finite ribbons, we demonstrate time- and space-resolved imaging of Floquet-induced topological edge states and identify the ribbon-width scale below which edge state protection breaks down. We further show how band structures of graphene nanoribbons and Floquet chiral edge modes can be reconstructed via Floquet quasiparticle interference. Finally we demonstrate that chiral impurities that break time-reversal symmetry induce characteristic spatial THz-STM signatures that can be used as a direct probe of Floquet edge state chirality.

Solute segregation to interfaces significantly impacts material behavior. A large majority of theoretical works focus on grain boundaries and coherent interfaces. Studies on semi-coherent interfaces are usually prohibited by the structural complexity, yielding models beyond the practical capability of density functional theory (DFT), or chemical complexity, restricted by the availability of (classical) interatomic potentials. This work investigates solute segregation to the coherent and semi-coherent $α$-Fe/Fe$_3$C interface in pearlite and its effect on mechanical properties using novel universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). DFT calculated solution enthalpies, segregation energetics, and changes in cohesion at the coherent interface are used to benchmark several state-of-the-art uMLIPs. We find that the GRACE-2L-OAM and GRACE-2L-OMAT models most accurately reproduce the quantum-mechanical predictions. While Cu has the strongest segregation energy of $\approx$ -0.3 eV to the coherent interface among the investigated tramp and trace elements, all of them, As, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, P, Sb, and Sn, exhibit significantly more negative segregation values reaching below $\approx$ -1.5 eV in the presence of the misfit dislocation at the semi-coherent interface. The deepest traps are identified in the vicinity of the dislocation core, although the spatial distribution of segregation energies differs markedly among the solute species. The cohesion of the coherent interface is strongly reduced by Sb, Sn, P, and As, and only mildly by Cu, whereas Ni shows a negligible effect, and Cr and Mo slightly enhance cohesion. In contrast, all investigated solutes (except for P) tend to embrittle the semi-coherent interface, with Sn and, especially, Sb having the strongest impact in tensile tests performed in the out-of-plane direction.

Spin textures are ubiquitous in antiferromagnets, yet their consequences for altermagnets remain largely unexplored. We show that spatial variations of the Néel order act on the low-energy electrons as effective gauge fields, leading to strong anisotropies in both dc transport and optical absorption, even without intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. As a concrete example, we analyze a coplanar spin helix and predict that the principal axes of the conductivity and linear dichroism are set by the helix wave vector and can be tuned by the texture geometry. Our results point to polarization-resolved optics and anisotropic transport as direct probes of textured altermagnetic states, and suggest a simple route to direction-selectivity.

- **TL;DR**: CuF₂中平面d波自旋分裂向体d波自旋分裂的转变主要由F离子的反极性位移驱动，这引入了额外的磁八极矩分量，从而改变了自旋分裂模式。

With the advent of nonrelativistic spin splitting in collinear compensated antiferromagnets, several candidate materials have also been proposed, among which the family of transition-metal difluorides stands out as a prominent example. Within this family, most members exhibit planar $d$-wave spin splitting, whereas CuF$_2$ shows bulk $d$-wave splitting with an explicit $k_z$ dependence. In this work, we show that this transition from planar to bulk $d$-wave splitting in CuF$_2$ is primarily driven by the antipolar displacements of the F ions, which are absent in the tetragonal rutile structure of the other family members. Our calculations reveal that these additional structural distortions introduce an extra plane of anisotropic magnetization density, giving rise to an additional totally symmetric component of the magnetic octupole tensor. The $k$-space representation of this octupole component, consequently, dictates an additional direction of spin splitting, thereby transforming the $d$-wave spin splitting pattern from planar to bulk-like. We further analyze the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the magnetic octupoles and the resulting spin splitting in the band structure. Our work highlights the possibility of controlling the pattern of nonrelativistic spin splitting through structural modifications, for example, via the application of external pressure.

- **TL;DR**: 通过面内压缩应变可有效抑制h-FeS的自发反常霍尔效应和净磁化，揭示了微小净磁化与自发AHE之间的强相关性，为自旋电子学应用提供了应变调控手段。

Altermagnets are collinear magnetic materials with 'alter'nating local crystalline environments, characterized by joint spin and crystalline symmetries that enable ferromagnetic-like transport properties but with vanishing net magnetization. Hexagonal FeS (h-FeS) is a recently identified altermagnet candidate that shows a spontaneous anomalous Hall effect (AHE) accompanied by a tiny net magnetization. Here, we show that both the spontaneous AHE and magnetization can be effectively suppressed by an in-plane compressive strain. Since neutron diffraction measurements show that the applied uniaxial strain only modifies the in-plane domain population but does not affect the in-plane magnetic structure, the major effect of the applied strain is to tune the small $c$-axis ferromagnetic moment. Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between the tiny net magnetization and the spontaneous AHE in h-FeS, and show that uniaxial strain provides an effective knob to tune both properties in this altermagnet candidate for spintronic applications.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文研究了自由电子与材料相互作用导致的退相干效应，建立了描述任意材料体相和表面自由电子退相干的统一理论框架，并展示了其在纳米尺度测温中的应用潜力。

Electron microscopy relies on the spatial coherence of electron beams to generate atomic-scale images using interference and diffraction, which can be degraded by inelastic scattering processes that induce decoherence. Here, we present a theoretical study of decoherence arising from the electromagnetic interaction of free electrons with bulk materials and planar surfaces. We show that bulk plasmons dominate decoherence in Al and Au, while electronic excitations above the band gap, supplemented by weaker coupling to phononic and guided modes, are the primary channels in ionic insulators such as LiF. A thermal population of electromagnetic modes leads to a divergence in the energy-loss probability at low frequencies, which in turn produces a pronounced temperature dependence. We show that this effect can be exploited for nanoscale thermometry, predicting that optimized energy-filtered holography enables $\sim0.1\%$ changes in fringe visibility for physically viable temperature variations in metals. Through these results, we establish a unified theoretical framework to describe free-electron decoherence in the bulk and surfaces of arbitrary materials.

- **TL;DR**: Ru缺陷显著改变SrRuO3薄膜的电子输运和磁性质：抑制相干输运、降低饱和磁化强度、增强界面垂直磁各向异性，使其呈现类铁磁绝缘体行为。

While stoichiometric SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) is a metallic itinerant ferromagnet with relatively homogeneous magnetization, Ru deficiency provides a powerful route to alter its electronic transport and depth-dependent magnetic properties. Ru-deficient SRO thin films grown by radio-frequency high oxygen pressure sputtering were investigated using a combination of X-ray reflectivity, polarized neutron reflectometry, off-specular neutron scattering, scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, electrical transport, and magnetometry. Structural and compositional analyses reveal that Ru deficiency is intrinsic to the films, with an enhanced deficiency at the interfaces. As a result, coherent electronic transport is suppressed and the saturation magnetization is reduced, while the Curie temperature remains largely unaffected, placing Ru-deficient SRO in a regime consistent with ferromagnetic insulator-like behavior. Depth- and lateral-resolved magnetic measurements further show that the interfacial regions remain ferromagnetic but exhibit enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which constrains the local magnetization to remain predominantly out-of-plane and strongly reduces its in-plane projection. Our results establish Ru deficiency as a key control parameter governing transport, magnetization, and anisotropy in SRO thin films and highlight defect and interface engineering as powerful routes to tailor interfacial magnetism in correlated oxide heterostructures.

- **TL;DR**: 利用瞬态吸收光谱首次直接观测到4H-SiC中硅空位缺陷的V2'四重态跃迁，并解析了自旋双重态能级中的多个光学跃迁，通过多技术结合阐明了完整的电子能级结构。

Point defects in silicon carbide (SiC), particularly the negatively-charged silicon vacancy ($\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$) in 4H-SiC, are leading candidates for scalable quantum technologies due to their favorable spin-optical properties and compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication processes. Comprehensive knowledge of a defect's electronic structure is essential for interpreting spin-optical dynamics and for the reliable design and optimization of defect-based quantum devices. Despite extensive study, our knowledge of the electronic structure of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ is limited since key excited-state manifolds have remained inaccessible to conventional steady-state spectroscopy. In this study, transient absorption spectroscopy is utilized to probe non-equilibrium electronic transitions of $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ and to uncover previously unobserved excited states. The first direct observation of the elusive V2' quartet transition is presented, with its broad spectral signature attributed to nonadiabatic vibronic coupling. Within the spin-doublet manifold, which is central to optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) but has remained unresolved spectroscopically, multiple optical transitions are identified. The complete electronic level structure in the relevant energy range is elucidated by combining polarization-resolved spectroscopy, group-theoretical analysis, quantum embedding calculations and first-principles optical lineshape modeling. Collectively, these results provide a microscopic understanding of the $\mathrm{V_{Si}^{-}}$\ electronic structure. Our approach also establishes a general framework for resolving and understanding complex excited-state manifolds in wide-bandgap color centers.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种新型混合模拟方法，通过准原子和机器学习优化，实现固体临界区域（接触面、裂纹等）的原子模拟与其他区域的连续介质模拟的同步计算。

We report a novel hybrid method of simultaneous atomistic simulation of solids in critical regions (contacts surfaces, cracks areas, etc.), along with continuum modeling of other parts. The continuum is treated in terms of quasi-atoms of different size, comprising composite medium. The parameters of interaction potential between the quasi-atoms are optimized to match elastic properties of the composite medium to those of the atomic one. The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method. We demonstrate a significant superiority of our approach in computational speed and implementation convenience. Finally, we discuss a possible extension of the method for modeling other phenomena.

- **TL;DR**: TaSb₂具有罕见的双重拓扑相，研究揭示了其弱拓扑绝缘体表面上的自旋动量锁定拓扑表面态

TaSb$_2$, a member of the transition metal dipnictide family of materials, hosts the very rare dual topological phase - weak topological insulating state and topological crystalline insulating state along different crystallographic orientations. So far, studies on the electronic structure of transition metal dipnictides have focused on their overall electronic structure and the bulk open-orbit Fermi surfaces. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and transport measurements, we distinguish the intertwined bulk and surface states on the weakly topological $(20\bar{1})$ plane of TaSb$_2$. We identify multiple electron- and hole-like bulk bands, yielding a near-perfect carrier compensation. Crucially, we observe open-orbit FSs parallel to $\bar{L}$-$\bar{Y}$ direction that are entirely of surface origin. Circular-dichroism ARPES reveals $k \rightarrow -k$ spectral reversal, indicating spin-momentum locking and the topological nature of these surface states. Consistent with this, magnetotransport measurements display weak antilocalization, establishing TaSb$_2$ as a platform for spin-polarized topological transport on a weakly topological surface.

- **TL;DR**: 利用反应射频磁控溅射在Si衬底上低温生长垂直排列ZnO纳米柱，通过调控溅射压力和衬底预处理控制纳米结构形貌和极性，获得高性能压电特性

We report the low temperature growth of vertically aligned ZnO nanocolumns on Si substrates by using reactive radio frequency magnetron sputtering.High sputtering pressure combined with low substrate temperatures induce a pronounced self shadowing effect,leading to the formation of isolated nanocolumns. In contrast, lower sputtering pressure promotes void filling in deposited films, favouring the growth of dense, low roughness columnar films. Modification of native SiOx on Si surfaces via substrate preheating prior to deposition, alters the initial nucleation stage, thereby determining dominant polarity and morphology of ZnO nanostructures. O polar columnar films and nanocolumns exhibit higher effective piezoelectric coefficient, corresponding to their higher differential resistance and reduced dielectric loss, suggesting suppressed carrier induced screening of piezoelectric charges. This low thermal budget, scalable sputtering approach provides an alternative route for integrating ZnO nanostructures onto thermal constrained substrates, including those used in flexible and wearable electronics.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究确认TaIrTe₄中的异常光电流源于横向热电效应，而非非线性电荷响应，并通过晶体边缘/电极取向调控和热环境工程来增强光电流响应。

Anomalous local photocurrent generation via second-order nonlinear and thermoelectric responses is a signature of many topological semimetals. The emergence of these photocurrents is inherently linked to symmetry breaking and anisotropy of their crystal lattices. Studies of type-II Weyl semimetals of group C$_{2v}$ (WTe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, TaIrTe$_4$) have reported anomalous, nonlocal photocurrents localized to crystals edges or far from electrodes, which are highly dependent on the geometry of the material sample. While originally attributed to a nonlinear charge current response, it was recently shown that these currents could instead be attributed to the anisotropic Seebeck coefficients of the materials. Here, we confirm that anomalous photocurrents observed in TaIrTe$_4$ under either visible or far-infrared far-field illumination originate from the large transverse thermoelectric effect. We engineer the mutual orientation of crystal edges and electrodes as well as the thermal environment of TaIrTe$_4$ to control and amplify its spatial photocurrent response. We show that substrate engineering can locally enhance photocurrent. This framework of thermal device engineering can enable broadband photo detection schemes by leveraging spectral and spatial dependence of photocurrents for applications like wavefront sensing, beam positioning, and edge detection.

Cross-plane heat transport is a critical bottleneck for van der Waals (vdW) electronics, yet its microscopic governing principles remain elusive. We demonstrate that stacking order is an effective control knob for cross-plane phonon transport in multilayer Rhenium Disulfide (ReS2). Thickness-dependent thermal conductivity measurements reveal remarkably long cross-plane phonon mean free paths (MFPs) (&gt;= 200-300 nm) and provide a direct experimental observation of the transition from quasi-ballistic transport to a thickness-independent ballistic limit. AA stacking exhibits nearly double the cross-plane thermal conductivity of AB stacking, driven by longer acoustic phonon lifetimes from a more "coherent" interlayer registry. Integrated deep neural-network molecular dynamics reveals that phonon filtering in ReS2 is fundamentally frequency-selective: weak vdW coupling acts as a low-pass filter, whereas stronger coupling broadens the transmission passband. These results establish ReS2 as a model system where stacking order and interlayer coupling can be engineered to tune heat conduction across diffusive, quasi-ballistic, and ballistic regimes, offering a new framework for thermal management in 2D electronics.
