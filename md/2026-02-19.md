Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.

Symmetry offers a useful approach to unfold the intertwined degrees of freedom. Thus it paves the way to resolve coexisting quantum orders into distinct symmetry sectors. Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in nano-flaked IrTe$_2$, we investigate the superconductivity in strain-stabilized two-dimensional (2D) limit of IrTe$_2$ by combining density-functional theory with mean-field solution of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction on a symmetry-constrained ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ model. The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $Γ$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities.

- **TL;DR**: 双层超导体中发现了超导相位退相干的新层次结构：二极管非互易性、约瑟夫森相干性和超导能隙在不同温度下依次消失，而非传统认为的同时消失。

Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_η$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出在两种超导态转变附近，通过选择参数使系统在增加超电流时，在一个电流方向切换到不同的超导序而另一个方向不切换，可以显著增强超导二极管效率。

We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent.

Interfacial thermal transport between graphene and water plays a critical role in a wide range of thermal and energy applications. Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties.

### Zero Indirect Band Gap and Flat Bands in a Niobium Oxyiodide Cluster Material

- **TL;DR**: 在NbI4-Li2(CN2)-Li2O反应体系中发现了两种新的铌氧碘簇合物Nb6O3I15和Nb11O6I24，它们基于蝶形氧封端的[Nb4O]簇核扩展而成，具有独特的结构和电子特性。

Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.

We show that deliberately breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate the reverse process without changing the stationary distribution. Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.

### A Unified Formulation for $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle $ in Two-Component TDDFT

Two-component linear-response time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) provides a unified framework that encompasses noncollinear excitations in noncollinear reference states, as well as both spin-conserving and spin-flip excitations in collinear reference states. In this work, we present a general formalism for evaluating the expectation value $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ of electronically excited states obtained within two-component TDDFT. We then derive and analyze specialized forms of the resulting equations for collinear reference determinants, for which the two-component formalism decomposes into conventional spin-conserving and spin-flip TDDFT. The resulting working equations are systematically compared with previously proposed theoretical approaches. On the basis of our analysis, $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ in the excited states is shown to arise from two distinct sources: (i) $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle_0$ in the reference state and (ii) additional $Δ\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ introduced by the excitation process itself. Finally, we evaluate the expectation value $\langle \hat{S}^2 \rangle$ by performing two-component TDDFT calculations based on two-component DFT, unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS), and restricted open-shell Kohn-Sham (ROKS) reference states, respectively.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的弹簧-阻尼器型滚动摩擦模型，将参数减少到单个物理量——临界滚动角，简化了非球形颗粒DEM模拟的校准过程。

Simulating granular materials composed of non-spherical particles remains a major challenge in discrete element method (DEM) simulations due to the complexity of contact detection and rotational dynamics, rendering large-scale simulations computationally prohibitive. To address this limitation, rolling friction is commonly introduced as an approximation to account for particle shape effects by applying a resistive torque to spherical particles. Among existing rolling friction formulations, the spring-dashpot (S-D) type model is widely recognized for its numerical stability and realistic representation of rolling resistance. However, conventional S-D models require multiple empirical parameters that must be calibrated in an interdependent manner, leading to increased experimental effort, parameter ambiguity, and uncertainty in practical applications. To overcome these issues, this study proposes a new S-D type rolling friction model that reduces the parameter set to a single physically meaningful quantity: the critical rolling angle. Derived from theoretical considerations, this parameter characterizes the transition from static to rolling motion at particle contacts. The use of a single parameter simplifies implementation and eliminates the need for extensive calibration. Stability analysis demonstrates that the proposed model allows particles to reach a physically consistent equilibrium state without spurious rotational oscillations. For large-scale applications, the model is further integrated into a coarse-grained DEM framework. Validation using DEM-CFD simulations of an incinerator system confirms that the proposed approach successfully reproduces the macroscopic behavior of the original particle system. Overall, this study enhances the applicability of DEM for industrial-scale simulations involving non-spherical particles.

Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.

Graphene-based systems have emerged as a rich platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena-including superconductivity, magnetism, and correlated insulating behavior-arising from flat electronic bands that enhance many-body interactions. Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moiré graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction. Our results establish dielectric-patterned graphene superlattices as a robust and controllable architecture for realizing flat-band-induced correlated phenomena beyond moiré systems.

- **TL;DR**: HoTe3中存在两种不同的反铁磁相（垂直条纹和倾斜条纹），与DyTe3、TbTe3、GdTe3不同，HoTe3中未发现磁性与电荷密度波的耦合。

The $R\mathrm{Te}_3$ ($R = \text{rare earth}$) family of layered van der Waals (vdW) compounds hosts coexisting magnetic and charge density wave (CDW) orders, yet the interplay between these degrees of freedom remains little explored. Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively. In contrast to the CDW-driven exotic magnetism in $\mathrm{DyTe}_3$, $\mathrm{TbTe}_3$, and $\mathrm{GdTe}_3$, we find no evidence for coupling between magnetism and CDW in $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$. The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems.

In one-dimensional systems, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) states are fragile by nature, as the injection of a non-zero energy density above the ground state is expected to restore the symmetry. This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states.

Biexcitonic states govern singlet fission, triplet-triplet and exciton-exciton annihilation, yet a unified understanding of how these processes compete within a shared electronic manifold remains elusive. We outline a conceptual framework based on fragment-based configuration-interaction that systematically constructs diabatic Hamiltonians spanning the full one-particle (LE, CT) and two-particle (LELE, CTCT, TT, CTX with X = LE, CT, or T) manifolds from monomer-local building blocks, preserving physical interpretability throughout. SymbolicCI provides analytic Hamiltonian matrix elements for efficient large-scale calculations; NOCI-F delivers benchmark-quality couplings. The resulting diabatic Hamiltonians can be coupled to quantum dynamics simulations. Applications to ethylene aggregates and the anthracene crystal reveal CTX configurations as electronic gateways bridging excitonic manifolds, with CT-mediated relaxation pathways competing with conventional annihilation. In H-type aggregates, LECT admixture stabilizes a "bi-excimer" analogous to one-particle excimers. By providing first-principles access to biexciton formation, separation, and transport, we hope to stimulate further exchange between electronic structure and quantum dynamics communities toward a predictive understanding of multiexcitonic photophysics.

This work develops a unified framework for inferring, representing, and statistically characterizing an anisotropic strength surface directly from molecular dynamics data. Large-scale tensile loading simulations are used to generate failure data across all principal stress ratios and loading orientations, facilitated by a data-driven mapping between imposed strain-rate tensors and resulting stresses. The orientation-dependent strength surface is then represented using a constrained parametric formulation in which the surface parameters vary smoothly with loading angle through a low-dimensional functional encoding. To deploy the framework, we specifically consider the case of monocrystalline graphene, which is a prototypical two-dimensional material that has been extensively characterized, both experimentally and computationally, in the literature. For defective graphene, multiple random realizations of vacancy defect distributions are used to construct a stochastic ensemble of angular strength surfaces. Because each anisotropic strength surface requires substantial atomistic sampling to construct, the resulting ensemble is inherently limited in size, motivating the use of compact encoding, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling to characterize strength variability. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis reveals a condensed latent representation of the fitted, encoded surfaces, where a Gaussian mixture model is employed to capture defect-induced variability, including rare outlier behaviors arising from clustered vacancy defects. Sampling from this probabilistic model enables the generation of new, physically admissible strength surfaces and the construction of confidence intervals in both parameter space and stress space.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种基于神经算子的中子输运计算替代模型框架，使用DeepONet和FNO两种架构学习从各向异性中子源到角通量的映射，在S_N本征值求解器中实现了显著加速。

This work introduces a neural operator based surrogate modeling framework for neutron transport computation. Two architectures, the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), were trained for fixed source problems to learn the mapping from anisotropic neutron sources, Q(x,μ), to the corresponding angular fluxes, ψ(x,μ), in a one-dimensional slab geometry. Three distinct models were trained for each neural operator, corresponding to different scattering ratios (c = 0.1, 0.5, & 1.0), providing insight into their performance across distinct transport regimes (absorption-dominated, moderate, and scattering-dominated). The models were subsequently evaluated on a wide range of previously unseen source configurations, demonstrating that FNO generally achieves higher predictive accuracy, while DeepONet offers greater computational efficiency. Both models offered significant speedups that become increasingly pronounced as the scattering ratio increases, requiring &lt;0.3% of the runtime of a conventional S_N solver. The surrogate models were further incorporated into the S_N k-eigenvalue solver, replacing the computationally intensive transport sweep loop with a single forward pass. Across varying fission cross sections and spatial-angular grids, both neural operator solvers reproduced reference eigenvalues with deviations up to 135 pcm for DeepONet and 112 pcm for FNO, while reducing runtime to &lt;0.1% of that of the S_N solver on relatively fine grids. These results demonstrate the strong potential of neural operator frameworks as accurate, efficient, and generalizable surrogates for neutron transport, paving the way for real-time digital twin applications and repeated evaluations, such as in design optimization.

The application of rare-earth complexes in electrically driven light sources poses a series of challenges that require specific optimization of the molecular photophysical properties. Here, we present a report on films of three different Eu3+ complexes characterized in terms of emission spectra and fluorescence decay. We compare molecular complexes in powder form and sublimed films, in films on glass and on a metal surface, and in films of thicknesses down to less than 3 nm (&lt; 3 ML), approaching electrical coupling. Our photoluminescence experiments supported by scanning tunneling microscopy of sub-monolayers indicate that Eu3+(trensal) complexes are less affected by sublimation and more stable on the metal surface than typical beta diketonate complexes, making them promising candidates for electroluminescence devices.

- **TL;DR**: 提出Liouvillian插值方法，解决传统CDMFT和DCA插值中的非物理问题，保持因果性并更好捕捉复杂结构

Two widely-used non-local extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), cellular DMFT (CDMFT) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), both yield self-energies marred by having some unphysical properties: CDMFT yields real-space self-energies that are not translationally invariant, and DCA yields momentum-space self-energies with discontinuities in their momentum dependence. It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface.

In this paper, we introduce a new order parameter called the weighted coordination number (WCN) to study the liquid-liquid (LL) phase separation, using the temperature-dependent coarsening of the LL interface as a possible mechanism for the glass transition. The well-established glass-forming Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system is used for our studies. The gas-liquid binodal line is reconstructed using the WCNs, and the same approach is extended to study the liquid-liquid binodal line. Systems of various densities are instantaneously quenched from high to low temperatures where a liquid-liquid separation is observed. Densities and the composition of each liquid state are used to check the level rule, along with density and pressure profiles, demonstrating local equilibrium of liquid-liquid phase separation. The transition from the liquid-liquid phase separation in the supercooled region to the glass transition region is modeled by adopting a Markov Network Model to estimate the temperature dependent viscosity using liquid-liquid interfacial information from the classification.

- **TL;DR**: 研究通过分子动力学模拟和激子密度分析，发现双(二吡啶)锌(II)中配体间的动态角度波动会偶然增强激子耦合，从而加速激子转移

Exciton transfer dynamics between chromophores depends on excitonic coupling, which is governed by relative orientation between the chromophores. While the excitonic coupling is treated as a static parameter in many cases, structural dynamics can introduce time-dependence on the excitonic coupling. However, influence of the dynamics of excitonic coupling on the exciton transfer has been scarcely understood. In the present study, exciton transfer under dynamical fluctuation in excitonic coupling was investigated via combined use of non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, exciton density analysis, and a simple two-state model, for inter-ligand exciton transfer in bis(dipyrrinato)Zn(II) as the example case. The reaction coordinate for the exciton transfer was obtained a posteriori via regression analysis where the target and explanatory variables are diabatic energy gaps and atomic displacements, respectively. The results suggest that dynamical angular fluctuation between the two dipyrrinato ligands incidentally increase the excitonic coupling, accelerating the exciton transfer between the ligands.

### Twist-induced Out-of-plane Ferroelectricity in Bilayer Hafnia

- **TL;DR**: 扭曲双层1T-HfO2通过堆叠诱导对称性破缺实现可切换的面外铁电性，为原子级薄存储器提供新平台。

Ferroelectric HfO2 is a promising candidate for next-generation memory devices due to its CMOS compatibility and ability to retain polarization at nanometer scales. However, the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca2_1) responsible for ferroelectricity is metastable and requires extrinsic stabilization, which makes it challenging for integration with silicon. We predict that bilayer 1T-HfO2 can exhibit robust and switchable out-of-plane (OOP) polarization arising from stacking-induced symmetry breaking. Using first-principles density functional theory, we predict that monolayer 1T-HfO2 can be cleaved from the (111) surface of cubic hafnia, and the monolayer is dynamically stable. When two aligned monolayers are twisted to form a moiré superlattice, it breaks the interlayer symmetry and allows the emergence of bistable OOP polarization. At a twist angle of 7.34o, the system exhibits a net polarization of ~16 μC/cm2. This sizeable polarization is due to the large polar displacements concentrated in AB stacking domains. Importantly, this polarization can be reversibly switched via interlayer sliding with a low energy barrier (~8 meV/formula unit) and comparable low coercive field (~0.2 V/nm), offering electric-field tunability. These findings establish twisted bilayer 1T-HfO2 as a scalable and robust 2D ferroelectric platform, enabling new pathways for integrating ferroelectric functionality into atomically thin memory and logic devices.

It is with great regret that Prof. Wolfgang Helfrich passed away on 28 September 2025 in Berlin. As the founder of the membrane liquid crystal model, Prof. Helfrich made outstanding contributions to membrane physics and liquid crystal display technology. This review article is written in his memory. Biomembranes, primarily composed of lipid bilayers, are not merely passive barriers but dynamic and complex materials whose shapes are governed by the principles of soft matter physics. This review explores the shape problem in biomembranes through the lens of material science and liquid crystal theory. Beginning with classical analogies to crystals and soap bubbles, it details the application of the Helfrich elastic model to explain the biconcave shape of red blood cells. The discussion extends to multi-layer systems, drawing parallels between the focal conic structures of smectic liquid crystals, the geometries of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, and the reversible transitions in peptide assemblies. Furthermore, it examines icosahedral self-assemblies and shape formation in two-dimensional lipid monolayers at air/water interfaces. At the end of the paper, we find that the shapes such as cylinders, spheres, tori, bicocave discoids and Delaunay surfaces form a group. This result is merely an intrinsic geometric feature of these shapes and is independent of the biomembrane equation. When the pressure on the membrane, surface tension, and bending modules meet certain conditions, the biomembrane will take on these shapes. The review concludes by highlighting the unifying power of continuum elastic theories in describing a vast array of membrane morphologies across biological and synthetic systems.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文展示了量子系统可以从二维拓扑绝缘体平滑过渡到一维拓扑绝缘体，而无需关闭能隙，实现了维度间的拓扑相变。

Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.

An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |θ|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $θ$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.

The calculation of thermal conductivity in insulating solids at temperatures below the Debye temperature is problematic, due to the breakdown of classical and semi-classical approaches. In this work, we present a fully quantum methodology to compute thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations combined with the Green-Kubo linear response theory. The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations.

Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.

Chromium thiophosphate is a long-known material: a layered semiconducting antiferromagnet. Its recently discovered gate-tunable metamagnetic phase transitions, the remarkable positive and oscillating magnetoresistance as a tunnel barrier, and its Fano-resonance luminescence, elusive among the multitude of Cr3+ compounds, call for revisiting the understanding of its electronic structure, especially regarding how it relates to magnetic order. Here, we employ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, implemented in both absorption and resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopies, together with quantum many-body calculations, to unveil the complex nature of magnetoelectronic coupling in CrPS4, featuring hybridization between crystal-field and charge-transfer transitions. We reveal the role of extended superexchange paths involving P and S atoms, mediating interactions between the Cr spins across the different magnetic phases: antiferromagnetic, canted, and ferromagnetic. Our results elucidate the electronic states involved in these phases and provide prescriptions for engineering the metamagnetic phase diagram of CrPS4.

Nonlinear optical (NLO) materials are essential for many photonic, telecommunication, and laser technologies, yet discovering better NLO molecules is computationally challenging due to the vast chemical space and competing objectives. We compare evolutionary algorithms for molecular design, targeting four objectives: maximizing the ratio of first-to-second hyperpolarizability $(β/γ)$, optimizing HOMO-LUMO gap and linear polarizability to target ranges, and minimizing energy per atom. We encode molecules as SMILES strings and evaluate their properties using quantum-chemical calculations. We compare NSGA-II, MAP-Elites, MOME, a single-objective $(μ+λ)$ evolutionary algorithm, and simulated annealing. Quality diversity methods maintain archives across a measure space defined by atom and bond count, enabling the discovery of structurally diverse molecules. Our results demonstrate that NSGA-II consistently earns high scores in every objective, leading to high-quality molecules, but MOME does a better job exploring a wide range of possibilities, resulting in higher global hypervolume and MOQD scores. However, each method has strengths and weaknesses, and produced many promising molecules.

Confinement epitaxy beneath graphene stabilizes exotic material phases by restricting vertical growth and altering lateral diffusion, conditions unattainable on bare substrates. However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms.

The potential for topological Kondo insulating behavior in d-electron systems has attracted interest in studying the surface states of the correlated insulators FeSb2 and FeSi. While detailed studies and theoretical description of a spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic surface state have been applied to FeSi, the magnetic properties of the surface states of FeSb2 have not been addressed. Here, we report on the surface magnetic properties of FeSb2, utilizing the surface area dependence of magnetic susceptibility to separate the surface Curie-Weiss temperature dependence from the bulk spin-gap susceptibility. We use these results to further extract the surface magnetic anisotropy of a thin, rough-surfaced single-crystal FeSb2 to compare with the observed magnetotransport anisotropy, and find good agreement between the anisotropy in the surface magnetization and surface magnetotransport. We conclude with evidence of an anomalous Hall contribution to the low-temperature surface transport.

- **TL;DR**: BA模型存在非平凡拓扑相变，从平凡拓扑过渡到非平凡拓扑，表现出自相似拓扑增长和幂律衰减行为。

We examine the homological structure of the Barabasi-Albert model, focusing on the time evolution of $Δ$-dimensional simplices and topological holes as functions of time $t$ and the attachment parameter $m$ (the number of edges added by each incoming node). Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(Δ, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $Δ$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $Δ$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point.

Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.

Extracting 3D atomic coordinates from spectroscopic data is a longstanding inverse problem. We present an equivariant diffusion model that generates site-specific 3D structures directly from near-edge spectra (ELNES/XANES). Trained on Si-O crystals, the model achieves radial accuracy comparable to Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) (RMSD ~0.06 Å) but with superior coordination number precision (errors &lt; 4.3% vs. EXAFS ~20%). Crucially, it reconstructs full 3D geometries including bond angles, overcoming the limitations of 1D radial distribution analysis. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, accurately predicting local structures in amorphous systems despite being trained exclusively on crystalline lattices. Application to experimental O K-edge spectra from α-quartz validates practical applicability. This generative approach outperforms template matching and establishes automated, quantitative 3D structure determination from spectroscopic data.

We compare the ability of a simulated annealing program and an evolutionary algorithm to find molecules with large molecular average hyperpolarizabilities. This property is an important component of nonlinear optical materials. Both optimization programs represent molecules as SMILES strings, a method that is widely used by chemists to describe molecular structure using short ASCII strings. Our results suggest that both approaches are comparable and can be used to solve a variety of more realistic problems of interest to chemists and material scientists.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过光谱学方法揭示了CsPbBr3微晶中同时存在高能激子和Rashba激子，每种激子都有特定的声子复制系列，并发现了激子-声子耦合的特异性。

Exciton-phonon interactions govern the optical response of semiconductors, yet disentangling multiple coupling channels in lead halide perovskites remains challenging. We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications.

- **TL;DR**: 研究退相干纯态拓扑序得到的混合态相中的普适纠缠特征，重点关注对数纠缠负性和互信息中的拓扑修正：拓扑纠缠负性(TEN)和拓扑互信息(TMI)。

We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了在自旋S较大时，量子自旋系统的配分函数渐近形式与经典模型一致，为磁性材料的经典建模提供了理论基础，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟验证了多种材料的相变温度。

We consider quantum-to-classical mapping for an arbitrary system of interacting spins at finite temperatures. We prove that, in the large-$S$ limit, the asymptotic form of the partition function coincides with that of a classical model for spins of length $S_C=\sqrt{S(S+1)}$. Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians. As an application, the classical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute transition temperatures for several topical materials with known interaction parameters, including MnF$_2$, MnTe, Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, MnPSe$_3$, FePS$_3$, FePSe$_3$, CoPS$_3$, CrSBr, and CrI$_3$. The resulting transition temperatures show good agreement with experimental data.

- **TL;DR**: 本文揭示了半共格析出相界面迁移的微观机制：界面位错的非保守运动与纳米级生长台阶的形核和横向传播相耦合，为板条生长提供了基于缺陷的动力学描述。

Precipitate shape and size control the strength and stability of many structural alloys, yet the microscopic mechanism by which semicoherent precipitate interfaces migrate remains unclear. In particular, how dense interfacial dislocation networks move while accommodating transformation strain has resisted direct, time-resolved characterization. Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution.

- **TL;DR**: 提出数据驱动框架，从实验透射率测量中提取混合光致变色薄膜的有效光学常数，解决传统模拟计算成本高且与实验分布不匹配的问题。

Photochromic materials enable dynamic optical modulation through reversible transitions between distinct absorption states, with broad potential for smart windows, adaptive optics, and reconfigurable photonic devices. Micron-scale photochromic hybrid films present a particularly attractive platform for these applications, combining straightforward preparation with substantial optical modulation and scalability for high-volume fabrication. However, rational design of such films remains fundamentally constrained by the absence of well-defined optical constants. Unlike homogeneous thin films, micron-scale hybrid photochromic materials comprise active particles dispersed non-uniformly within polymer matrices. Conventional first-principles electromagnetic simulations face substantial computational costs and discrepancies between simulated and experimental particle distributions. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework that extracts effective optical constants directly from minimal experimental transmittance measurements. Our dual-state effective model approximates the complex inhomogeneous photochromic layer as a compressed homogeneous medium characterized by pseudo-refractive indices and pseudo-extinction coefficients for both pristine and UV-irradiated states. Through systematic optimization against experimental data from tungsten oxide-polyvinylpyrrolidone hybrid films, we determine wavelength-dependent pseudo-optical constants and compression ratios that enable accurate prediction of optical modulation within the tested thickness range. Our methodology establishes a framework for engineering hybrid photochromic systems and demonstrates how data-driven modeling can overcome limitations in characterizing complex nanostructured materials.

We present a systematic construction of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices whose Bloch spectra are $n$th roots of those of Hermitian parent two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely graphene and the Lieb lattice. The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an "exceptional horn" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\sim\vert \mathbf{q}\vert^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\simφ^{\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.

We use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations with bond dimensions up to $20\ 000$ to determine the magnetization curves of spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Both models exhibit a robust half-magnetization plateau, and we find that the same 16-site state (quadrupled unit cell) is selected in both cases on the largest 64-site cubic cluster we consider for the plateau state. This contrasts sharply with the effective quantum dimer model prediction which favors the ``R'' state, and demonstrates the breakdown of the perturbative mechanism at the Heisenberg point. These results provide a nonperturbative characterization of field-induced phases in pyrochlore magnets and predictive guidance for spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ materials.

- **TL;DR**: 该研究通过模拟和理论模型揭示了金属玻璃中负应变率敏感性的机制，发现当外部加载时间尺度超过剪切转变区松弛时间尺度时，负应变率敏感性主要源于激活势垒的时间演化。

When strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) is negative in metallic glasses, the material becomes weaker as the deformation rate increases, leading to accelerated plastic deformation and, eventually, catastrophic fracture. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the negative SRS using micromechanics-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that couple heterogeneous randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) models for metallic glasses. The model accounted for both the thermomechanical structural rejuvenation and relaxation of the energy barrier for thermal activation of STZs, incorporating a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)-type relaxation function. The present simulations systematically reproduce the dependence of flow stresses on strain rate, temperature, and the form of the relaxation function. The SRS tends to decrease at high strain rates and low temperatures in the simulations, and negative SRS appears when a compressed-exponential relaxation function is employed. Shear localization also appears; however, the conditions under which the observed localization emerges do not fully coincide with those leading to the negative SRS, leaving the dominant factor unclear. To clarify the dominant factor, we introduce a simplified theoretical model that reproduces flow stresses consistent with the simulation results. An analytical expression derived from the theoretical model reveals that negative SRS originates primarily from the temporal evolution of the activation barrier. Specifically, negative SRS arises when the timescale of external loading exceeds that of STZ relaxation.

- **TL;DR**: 研究镁钇合金压缩变形中张力孪晶行为，发现钇含量增加抑制常见TT1孪晶但促进TT2孪晶，并通过晶体塑性模拟揭示了钇对孪晶活性和局部力学场的影响机制。

Twinning is a primary deformation mechanism in Mg alloys. This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for &lt;c+a&gt; slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications.

The melting of metallic nanoparticles is governed by surface pre-melting, a phenomenon traditionally modeled as the isotropic growth of a uniform liquid shell. Challenging this classical view, we report facet-dependent surface pre-melting in hexagonal close-packed Co nanoparticles, arising from the structural heterogeneity of the nanoparticle surface. Characterizing melting in molecular dynamics simulations (500 to 6000 atoms), we observe the onset of surface mobility, starting as low as $0.2\times T_{M,\infty}$ (the bulk melting point), driven by the early disordering of stepped $\{01\bar{1}1\}$ facets. We found that these facets consistently melt at temperatures nearly 200 Kelvin lower than flat $\{0001\}$ facets, regardless of particle size, and relate facets melting temperatures to the nanoparticle size via a 2D extension of the Gibbs-Thomson relation. We determine a critical liquid layer thickness that triggers the melting of the entire nanoparticle, which is found to be size-dependent. Our results confirm the recent experimental observation of the surface pre-melting effect, and extend it to anisotropic particles with different facet orientations.

The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films represents a significant advance in the field of nickelate superconductor. Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.

Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce WPEM, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\ce{PbSO4} and \ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition of a multiphase Ti--15Nb thin film, quantitative recovery of \ce{NaCl}--\ce{Li2CO3} mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous halos in semicrystalline polymers, high-throughput operando lattice tracking in layered cathodes, automated refinement of a compositionally disordered Ru--Mn oxide solid solution (CCDC 2530452), and quantitative phase-resolved deciphering of an ancient Egyptian make-up sample from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.

Using molecular dynamics simulations of an incommensurate Au(111)/graphite interface, we investigate the conditions under which structural lubricity produces load-independent friction. We show that strict load independence occurs only in laterally infinite, area-filling contacts, where dissipation is governed by phonon-mediated viscous coupling and the shear stress scales linearly with sliding velocity. Finite contacts with explicit boundary terminations exhibit substantially higher friction yet remain load independent up to a critical load. Load dependence arises only when elastic out-of-plane deformation near the contact line exceeds a critical amplitude, activating additional dissipation channels. These results demonstrate that contact geometry and local elastic compliance, rather than normal load itself, determine the onset and breakdown of load-independent structural lubricity.

Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\langle100\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures.

Bismuth oxide (Bi$_2$O$_3$) is a polymorphic material of considerable technological interest, with applications spanning from heterogeneous catalysis to next-generation nanoelectronics. Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $β$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance.

In principle, machine learning (ML) can be used to obtain any electronic property of a many-body system from its electron density within density functional theory. However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes.

Cerium hydride has a variety of interesting properties, including a known lattice contraction and densification with increasing hydrogen content. However, precise stoichiometric control is not experimentally straightforward and {\it ab initio} approaches are not computationally feasible for many properties such as melting and low temperature diffusion. Therefore, we develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for cerium hydride that is valid for H to Ce ratios from 2.0 to 3.0. A query-by-committee active learning approach is used to develop the training set. Leveraging classical molecular dynamics simulations, we assess a range of properties and provide fundamental mechanisms for the trends with stoichiometry. A majority of the properties follow the trend of lattice contraction, being governed by the stronger lattice binding induced by adding octahedral atoms.

Understanding mechanisms of ion transport in bulk materials is central to designing next-generation ion conductors for energy storage devices, yet studies employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) have largely been limited to reporting overall transport coefficients without a quantitative, spatiotemporally resolved breakdown of \emph{how} charge is carried. We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery.

We investigated the initial growth of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111) from sub-monolayer to multi-layer coverage by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction intensity analysis (LEED-IV), and density functional theory (DFT). In the submonolayer regime we find a stable and well-ordered $(5\times\sqrt{3})_{\mathrm{rect}}$ superstructure consisting of separated TiTe$_2$ molecules, whereby the Ti atoms substitute Au atoms of the first substrate layer as proven by LEED-IV. By adding further Ti and Te in a 1:2 ratio and proper annealing dealloying sets in and a homogeneous 1T-TiTe$_2$ monolayer film on an unreconstructed substrate is formed. The resulting moiré structure is close to a $(4 \times 4)$ superstructure w.r.t. Au(111) and has a slightly expanded in-plane lattice parameter compared to the 1T-TiTe$_2$ bulk value. With further stoichiometric deposition, thicker 1T-TiTe$_2$ films grow. Surprisingly, a five layer thick film exhibits an even larger lattice-parameter (1.5 % larger than the bulk value). All LEED-IV analyses are based on best-fit R-factors of $R \le 0.13$.

Recrystallization is a phenomenon in which a plastically deformed polycrystalline microstructure with a high dislocation density transforms into another that has low dislocation density. This evolution is driven by the stored energy in dislocations, rather than grain growth driven by grain boundary energy alone. One difficulty in quantitative modeling of recrystallization is the uncertainty in material parameters, which can be addressed by integration of experimental data into simulations. In this work, we compare simulated static recrystallization dynamics of a Mg-3Zn-0.1Ca wt.% alloy to experiments involving thermomechanical processing followed by measurements of the recrystallization fraction over time. The simulations are performed by combining PRISMS software for crystal plasticity and phase-field models (PRISMS-Plasticity and PRISMS-PF, respectively) in an integrated computational materials engineering framework. At 20% strain and annealing at 350 °C, the model accurately describes recrystallization dynamics up to a mobility-dependent time scale factor. While the average grain boundary mobility and the fraction of plastic work converted into stored energy are not precisely known, by fitting simulations to experimental data, we show that the average grain boundary mobility can be determined if the fraction of plastic work converted to stored energy is known, or vice versa. For low annealing temperatures, we observe a discrepancy between the model and experiments in the late stages of recrystallization, where a slowdown in recrystallization kinetics occurs in the experiments. We discuss possible sources of this slowdown and propose additional physical mechanisms that need to be accounted for in the model to improve its predictions.
