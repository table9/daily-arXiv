- **TL;DR**: 开发了一种结合高斯过程回归和线积分弦方法的增强技术，用于加速分子质子转移反应中的环聚合物瞬子计算，显著减少了力和Hessian矩阵的计算需求。

We develop a Gaussian process regression enhanced line integral string method to accelerate ring polymer instanton calculations of tunneling rates and tunneling splittings in molecular proton transfer reactions. By exploiting uncertainty estimates from the surrogate representation, we show that the number of force evaluations required to converge an instanton path becomes effectively independent of the number of beads used to discretize the pathway. To reduce the computational overhead associated with training, particularly when Hessian information is included, we implement graphics processing unit accelerated black box matrix matrix multiplication, achieving an order of magnitude speedups relative to standard implementations. For rate calculations, we introduce a selective Hessian training strategy that distinguishes flexible modes strongly coupled to the transferring proton from more rigid modes weakly coupled to the reaction coordinate. This enables the construction of accurate surrogate potential energy surfaces with substantially fewer Hessian evaluations. Applications to malonaldehyde and Z-3-aminopropenal demonstrate that tunneling rates can be predicted within 20% of exact values while reducing force and Hessian evaluations. The approach is further extended to tunneling splitting calculations for the formic acid dimer and malonaldehyde, yielding splittings in reasonable agreement with experiment and high level theoretical results.

- **TL;DR**: 提出随机张量收缩方法，显著降低量子化学中高阶张量收缩的计算成本，应用于耦合簇理论，将计算复杂度降至平均场水平

Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.

- **TL;DR**: 使用等变神经网络开发甲醇分子的电偶极矩和极化率表面，用于计算振动红外和拉曼强度

Electric dipole and polarizability surfaces are developed for the methanol molecule using {\it ab initio} electronic structure data, computed at the CCSD/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, and equivariant neural networks. These property surfaces are used to compute vibrational infrared and Raman intensities up to the OH stretching fundamental vibration. The intensity computations use the vibrational energies and wave functions obtained in continued variational vibrational computations from earlier work [J. Chem. Phys. 163, 064101 (2025)]. The vibrational representation accounts for the large-amplitude torsion and uses curvilinear normal coordinates for the small-amplitude modes, allowing truncation of the vibrational basis set and the integration grid.

- **TL;DR**: 通过掺杂半导体可提高金属/半导体界面的热边界电导，电流应用可使n型硅/钛界面热导增加40%，这为通过电效应精细调控界面热传输开辟了新途径。

Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.

- **TL;DR**: 这篇综述文章系统回顾了半局部泛函的理论基础，包括局部密度近似、广义梯度近似和元广义梯度近似，旨在为DFT领域的新手提供入门指导，并为从业者提供全面的参考资料。

Density functional theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure calculations, with wide-ranging applications in chemistry, physics, materials science, and machine learning. At its heart lies the exchange-correlation functional, a quantity which exactly encapsulates the many-body effects stemming from the quantum mechanical interactions between the electrons. Yet, the exact functional is unknown, and computationally tractable approximations are therefore necessary for practical applications. Over the past six decades, hundreds of density functional approximations have been proposed with varying degrees of accuracy and computational efficiency.
  This review surveys the theoretical foundations of semi-local functionals, including local density approximations, generalized gradient approximations, and meta-generalized gradient approximations. We provide a comprehensive, consistently organized discussion that consolidates both historical developments and recent advances in this field. Beginning with the essential concepts of Kohn-Sham density functional theory, we present the construction principles of semi-local exchange-correlation functionals. Special attention is given to the physical motivations underlying functional development, the mathematical properties that guide their construction, and the practical considerations that determine their applicability across different chemical and physical systems.
  This work is intended to serve as both a introduction for newcomers to the field and a comprehensive reference for practitioners. By consolidating the extensive literature on semi-local functionals and providing a unified framework for understanding their construction and application, we aim to facilitate further developments in density functional approximations and their use in tackling the diverse challenges of modern computational chemistry and condensed matter physics.

- **TL;DR**: 二维相互作用费米液体中三点点密度关联存在由费米海欧拉特征数决定的奇异结构

We characterize a singularity in the equal-time three-point density correlations that is generic to two-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids. In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\mathbf{q}_1\times\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids. Implications for quantum gas experiments are discussed.

- **TL;DR**: 在高压高温下合成纯体相岩盐结构LaO，发现其本征II型超导性，Tc约6K。通过Y掺杂和物理压力可将Tc提升至12.7K，这是镧单硫族化物中的最高Tc。

Lanthanum-based compounds are cornerstones of superconductivity research, yet the La-5d orbitals typically remain empty spectator states far above the Fermi level (EF). While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing. This work clarifies the intrinsic superconductivity of bulk LaO and provides a foundation for designing new rare-earth-based superconductors with higher TC

- **TL;DR**: 研究发现标准LLG方程熵产生率始终为正，而惯性LLG和开放系统LLG会出现暂时负熵产生率，表明非马尔可夫性。开放系统LLG的非马尔可夫性程度最高。

Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.

- **TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于几何守恒定律的动力学相场模型，用于控制固-固界面的合并行为，解决了传统相场模型在界面接近时强制合并的问题。

Conventional phase-field models often drive solid-solid interfaces to coalesce when in close proximity. This feature limits their use for processes like diffusion bonding, where the interfaces might need to remain distinct under certain thermodynamic conditions. We develop a kinetic phase-field model to address this problem, using an evolution equation based on a geometric conservation law for interfaces, rather than the gradient descent evolution that is typical in phase-field modeling. This formulation enables us to specify complex kinetic laws, and we use this to incorporate a physically-motivated geometric criterion to control interface merging. This criterion, based on nonlocal higher-derivative curvature invariants of the phase field, can be temperature-dependent, allows for a range of behaviors from complete coalescence to the preservation of distinct boundaries. Simulations show controlled bonding kinetics, demonstrating capabilities that are not available with existing methods for modeling interfaces that must remain distinct under given thermodynamic conditions.

- **TL;DR**: 提出蒸馏框架压缩eSPA集成模型，保持预测性能同时提升可解释性，用于ENSO长期预测分析

This paper introduces a distillation framework for an ensemble of entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) models, trained exclusively on satellite-era observational and reanalysis data to predict ENSO phase up to 24 months in advance. While eSPA ensembles yield state-of-the-art forecast skill, they are harder to interpret than individual eSPA models. We show how to compress the ensemble into a compact set of "distilled" models by aggregating the structure of only those ensemble members that make correct predictions. This process yields a single, diagnostically tractable model for each forecast lead time that preserves forecast performance while also enabling diagnostics that are impractical to implement on the full ensemble.
  An analysis of the regime persistence of the distilled model "superclusters", as well as cross-lead clustering consistency, shows that the discretised system accurately captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of ENSO. By considering the effective dimension of the feature importance vectors, the complexity of the input space required for correct ENSO phase prediction is shown to peak when forecasts must cross the boreal spring predictability barrier. Spatial importance maps derived from the feature importance vectors are introduced to identify where predictive information resides in each field and are shown to include known physical precursors at certain lead times. Case studies of key events are also presented, showing how fields reconstructed from distilled model centroids trace the evolution from extratropical and inter-basin precursors to the mature ENSO state. Overall, the distillation framework enables a rigorous investigation of long-range ENSO predictability that complements real-time data-driven operational forecasts.

Aqueous radiation chemistry emerges through ultrafast proton transfer and ion-radical formation
  with unexplored energy-redistribution dynamics steering the subsequent reactions. We performed
  time-resolved disruptive probing on pure water dimer, (H$_2$O)$_2$, to disentangle the post-ionization
  reactions. Through kinetic-energy-resolved ion imaging, we unraveled the dynamics in the (H$_2$O)$_2^+$
  ground state: at low-energy ($\sim$0.05 eV) ultrafast proton transfer ($\sim$19 fs) is
  followed by H$_3$O$^+$+OH fragmentation ($\sim$360~fs). At higher energies, proton
  transfer becomes hindered ($\sim$60 fs) while the subsequent fragmentation becomes faster
  ($\sim$210 fs), evolving into coupled dynamics ($&gt;0.15$ eV, $\sim$100 fs). Moreover, we
  observed H$_2$O)$_2^+$ stabilization proceeding through a Zundel-like structure. This reveals how
  ion-radical formation in ionized hydrogen-bonded networks shapes reactivity in aqueous dynamics.

### BaFe2Se3 a quasi-unidimensional non-centrosymmetric superconductor

The spin-ladder compounds of the BaFe2X3 (X = chalcogen) family may be viewed as dimensional reductions (along stripe-like motifs) of the two-dimensional iron-based pnictide planes extensively studied since 2006. Remarkably, despite their reduced dimensionality, these materials retain the capacity for unconventional ground states, exemplified by the emergence of superconductivity in \bfse\ under applied pressure beyond 10 GPa, following a structural phase transition at 4 GPa. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, which together elucidate the true crystallographic nature of this pressure-induced superconducting phase. While X-ray diffraction alone reveals a symmetry lowering from the widely accepted orthorhombic Cmcm group to a monoclinic structure, it lacks sufficient sensitivity to resolve the precise space group. By integrating vibrational spectroscopy with density functional theory, we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-pressure phase is non-centrosymmetric, adopting the polar space group P2_1. These findings not only revise the structural assignment of \bfse\ in its superconducting state but also establish its non-centrosymmetric character (an essential ingredient for potential unconventional pairing mechanisms- thereby opening new perspectives on the interplay between lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and superconductivity in iron-based materials.

- **TL;DR**: 重新审视具有乘性白噪声的过阻尼标量Langevin过程的费米子路径积分表示，重点研究生成泛函在非线性变量变换下的协变性

We revisit the construction of the fermionic path-integral representation of overdamped scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise, focusing on the covariance of the generating functional under non-linear changes of variables. We identify the transformations of the auxiliary (commuting and anticommuting) variables that ensure covariance under such transformations. The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics. Upon integrating out the auxiliary variables, we derive the Onsager-Machlup formulation, which agrees with the one recently obtained using a higher-order discretization scheme. In contrast to the latter, the construction proposed here is formulated directly in continuous time.

Hydrodynamic electrons in high-mobility graphene devices have demonstrated great potential in establishing an electronic analogue of relativistic quantum fluid in solid-state systems. One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs.

### Magnetoelectric Raman Force on Shear Phonons in a Frustrated van der Waals Bilayer Magnet

We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.

### Strain-Rate- and Line-Length-Dependent Screw Dislocation Glide Mechanisms in BCC Refractory Metals and Alloys

Plastic flow in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals and dilute/concentrated alloys is governed by the motion of &lt;111&gt; screw dislocations, whose glide is often impeded by cross-kinks (jogs). While existing strengthening models typically treat depinning as defect-assisted cutting or dislocation bowing, the combined strain-rate and dislocation-line-length dependence of cross-kink stability and effective obstacle spacing remains insufficiently resolved at the atomistic scale. Here, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and strain-boost hyperdynamics to investigate screw-dislocation glide in pure Nb and Mo, dilute Nb-Mo alloys, and equiatomic NbMo at 300 K over strain rates from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1 and dislocation line lengths from 15 to 50 nm. We first demonstrate that low-strain-rate simulations require sufficiently long dislocation lines to capture consistent cross-kink behavior and strength-determining pinning events. Using the 50~nm configurations, we show that cross-kinks form not only in concentrated alloys but also in pure BCC metals, with their stability governed by the relative rates of kink nucleation and migration on primary and cross-slip planes, which differ between Nb- and Mo-rich systems due to distinct core structures and non-Schmid responses. At high strain rates, depinning proceeds predominantly via vacancy-interstitial cluster formation. In contrast, at low strain rates and long line lengths, alternative pathways emerge, including lateral cross-kink migration, three-dimensional forward--backward cross-slip, and prismatic loop formation. The effective obstacle spacing controlling the critical resolved shear stress therefore emerges from coupled thermodynamic roughening and kinetic evolution. These findings highlight the intrinsically rate-, length-, and chemistry-dependent nature of screw-dislocation strengthening in BCC alloys.

### Machine Learning Hamiltonians are Accurate Energy-Force Predictors

- **TL;DR**: 提出QHFlow2模型，这是目前最先进的机器学习哈密顿量模型，在直接能量-力预测方面达到NequIP级别精度，同时显著降低能量误差

Recently, machine learning Hamiltonian (MLH) models have gained traction as fast approximations of electronic structures such as orbitals and electron densities, while also enabling direct evaluation of energies and forces from their predictions. However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations.

Phenomenological rules play a central role in the design of chemical reactions and materials with targeted properties. Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文建立了基于微观超导理论的框架，用于评估超导矩形波导在100GHz-THz频段的功率流衰减常数，分析了从脏极限到干净极限的电子平均自由程影响，并研究了TLS和强激发非线性效应。

Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $α$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\llξ_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\ggξ_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $α_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $α$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 Δ/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsimξ_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $α_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $α$ near $f\simeq Δ/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.

Matrix-product operators (MPOs) appear throughout the study of integrable lattice models, notably as the transfer matrices. They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest.

Pinning magnetization in a ferromagnetic thin film is commonly realized through exchange biasing with an adjacent antiferromagnet. Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices.

We investigate the interplay between lattice symmetry, phonons, and magnetism in the quasi-one-dimensional ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ by combining polarized synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, hybrid-functional density functional theory calculations, and inelastic neutron scattering. Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.

Achieving atomic precision in top-down manufacturing remains a fundamental challenge nanofabrication technology. Here, the focused electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope is used to demonstrate atomically precise sculpting of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) bilayers, achieving nanoribbons as narrow as 6 Å with atomically smooth edges. The key to this precision lies in understanding how the underlying atomic structure, particularly in twisted bilayer systems, influences the milling process. High-angle annular dark-field imaging combined with multislice simulations reveals distinct intensity signatures that allow identification of different stacking arrangements within moiré patterns. Mathematical analysis of moiré lattices provides a predictive framework for determining optimal cutting directions, with cuts along armchair directions yielding superior edge quality compared to zigzag orientations. Surprisingly, a sequential milling approach, where a small electron beam subscan area is translated during the process, produces significantly better results than parallel milling of the entire target region. To understand these differences we implemented a stochastic milling model that reveals that sequential milling minimizes unwanted exposure to surrounding material through beam tail effects. These findings establish a framework for achieving atomic precision in electron beam sculpting of two-dimensional materials and provide fundamental insights applicable to the broader challenge of top-down nanofabrication.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型和约束优化的晶体结构预测新方法，通过直接生成Wyckoff模式并确保代数一致性，实现了无需依赖现有数据库的物理有效晶体结构生成。

Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.

### Semiclassical theory for the orbital magnetic moment of superconducting quasiparticles

We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases.

The maturity of the chemical vapor deposition graphene-based device processing has increased from chip level demonstrations to wafer-scale fabrication in the past few years. Due to this wafer-scale, electrical characterization and analysis of the fabricated devices has become increasingly important to enable extraction of multiple parameters with minimal number of measurements for the quality control purposes critical for industrial uptake of 2D materials-based devices. As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources. The analysis shows that the optimized process offers high device yield of 98 % with good doping uniformity, contact resistance and mobility as well as low IV-curve hysteresis values on 200 mm wafers.

- **TL;DR**: Allegro MLIP模型通过多目标超参数优化和架构改进（添加MLP层和量子-经典混合层），在准确性和推理时间之间取得平衡，在多个数据集上超越了原始Allegro的准确性。

Allegro is a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) model designed to predict atomic properties in molecules using E(3) equivariant neural networks. When training this model, there tends to be a trade-off between accuracy and inference time. For this reason we apply multi-objective hyperparameter optimization to the two objectives. Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.

We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.

- **TL;DR**: 该论文证明了量子多体系统的局域平衡时间τ_eq存在一个普适下界：τ_eq ≥ αħ/T，其中α是仅依赖于维度和流体力学行为类型的无量纲系数。

The local equilibration time $τ_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $τ_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $τ_{\rm eq} \geq α\hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $α$ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种物理信息方法，通过将完整微磁能量纳入变分公式，从NV磁强计杂散场测量中重建复杂磁化纹理，并能优化传感器-样品距离参数。

Reconstructing complex magnetization textures from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry stray-field measurements presents a challenging inverse problem. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed method that addresses this by incorporating the full micromagnetic energy directly into the variational formulation. Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations.

X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) provides element-specific insight into local electronic and structural environments, but quantitative interpretation of molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) remains challenging due to finite-size effects and core-hole treatments. In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems.

We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $η$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.

The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.

Several factors may be responsible for disorder and frustration in a magnetic nanoparticle, including atomic vacancies on the surface and inside, impurity atoms, long-range magnetic exchange coupling, etc. We use Monte-Carlo simulations within the Heisenberg model to examine the role of randomly distributed atomic vacancies and long-range magnetic-exchange coupling on the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticles. In particular, we study the role of the second-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and missing atoms inside the particle resulting in broken nearby bonds. We find that both factors may enhance the superparamagnetic behaviors of such particles.

We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.

Interfacial orbital transport remains far less understood than its bulk counterpart despite its central role in orbitronic experiments. Here, we theoretically investigate the transmission and conversion of orbital angular momentum across a metallic interface using a model Hamiltonian incorporating crystal-field effects. We show that an injected orbital dipole moment undergoes pronounced oscillations driven by the crystal field and generates characteristic quadrupole moments determined by the orbital orientation relative to the interface. Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation.

The electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb was studied by a combination of low-energy photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\text{g}} = 1.52 \pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $Δ_{\text{SO}} = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $Γ$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $Δ_{Γ-\text{X}1} = 0.41 \pm 0.05$ eV and $Δ_{Γ-\text{X}2} = 0.65 \pm 0.05$ eV. The experimentally determined band gaps and side valley positions, as well as the energies of the final electronic states of optical transitions are in good agreement with the DFT calculations. The obtained data on the hot electron dynamics and electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb are crucial to improve the understanding of the photoemission processes in this material and will contribute to the development of the robust spin-polarized electron sources with multialkali photocathodes.

Moiré semiconductors built on angle-aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a physical realization of the Kondo lattice model, in which one TMD layer is prepared in a Mott insulating state supporting a lattice of local magnetic moments and the other layer in a metallic state supporting itinerant carriers. The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors.

We develop a hybrid Monte Carlo method to efficiently compute the physical observables from the samplings of the Laughlin and the Moore-Read wave functions of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. With the advancements in methodology, including global updates and double stereographic projection on spherical geometry, our hybrid Monte Carlo simulation is significantly faster than the widely used Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme. As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N &gt; 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere. Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence.

### Rotational Soft Modes and Octahedral Distortion as Design Principles for Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halide Materials

- **TL;DR**: 卤化物钙钛矿中极低晶格热导率源于两种机制：卤素-卤素旋转软模重塑低频声子谱并增强散射，以及静态八面体畸变增强非谐性降低声子寿命。

We establish that ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in halide perovskites and related octahedral framework materials arises from two distinct and complementary mechanisms: (i) halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes that reshape the low-frequency spectrum and intensify phonon scattering, and (ii) static octahedral distortions that further enhance anharmonicity and reduce phonon lifetimes. Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature. This work establishes halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes and octahedral distortions as transferable design principles for octahedra-containing halides, spanning both extended frameworks and molecular-cluster motifs, for discovering ultralow-kappa_L materials.

We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.

- **TL;DR**: 提出一种在纳米石墨烯π轨道中实现完全自旋极化费米面的有机材料策略，具有反铁磁耦合磁矩和平坦能带特性，适用于自旋电子学应用。

We propose a strategy to obtain conducting organic materials with fully spin-polarized Fermi surface, lying at a singular flat band, with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments that reside in pi-orbitals of nanographenes. We consider a honeycomb crystal whose unit cell combines two different molecules with S=1/2: an Aza-3-Triangulene, a molecule with orbital degeneracy, and a 2-Triangulene. The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications.

### Anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid for Coulomb interacting generalized Weyl fermions

- **TL;DR**: 三维广义外尔半金属中，由于准粒子色散的各向异性幂律行为，长程库仑相互作用效应被放大，导致各向异性边缘非费米液体行为。

Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n&gt;1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

- **TL;DR**: 毫米波硅光子晶体腔作为纳米材料微扰传感平台，兼容强磁场环境，在96GHz频率下实现超过10^5的品质因子，成功测量hBN-MLG异质结构的电导率

We introduce millimeter-wave silicon photonic crystal cavities as a versatile platform for the perturbative sensing of nanoscale materials. This dielectric-based platform is compatible with strong magnetic fields, opening avenues for studying quantum materials in extreme environments where superconducting cavities cannot operate. To establish the platform's performance, we cryogenically characterize a silicon photonic crystal cavity at 4.3 K, achieving a total quality factor exceeding $10^5$ for a 96 GHz mode. As a proof-of-concept for its sensing capabilities, we position a hexagonal boron nitride-multilayer graphene (hBN-MLG) heterostructure at an electric-field antinode of the cavity and measure the perturbative response at room temperature. The heterostructure induces a significant change in the cavity's resonance, from which we extract a total sample conductivity of approximately $5.1\times10^6$~S/m. These results establish silicon photonic crystal cavities as a promising platform for sensitive, on-chip spectroscopy of nanoscale materials at millimeter-wave frequencies.

Nonequilibrium manipulation of quantum materials via electromagnetic dressing provides an on-demand route to tailoring electronic band structures through Floquet engineering. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field.

The combinatorial approach applied to functional oxides has enabled the production of material libraries that formally contain infinite compositions. A complete ternary diagram can be obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on 100 mm silicon wafers. However, interest in such materials libraries is only meaningful if high-throughput characterization enables the information extraction from the as-deposited library in a reasonable time. While much commercial equipment allows for XY-resolved characterization at room temperature, very few sample holders have been made available to investigate structural, chemical, and functional properties at high temperatures in controlled atmospheres. In the present work, we present a furnace that enables the study of 100 mm wafers as a function of temperature. This furnace has a dome to control the atmosphere, typically varying from nitrogen gas to pure oxygen atmosphere with external control. We present the design of such a furnace and an example of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) measurements performed at the DiffAbs beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. We apply this high-throughput approach to a combinatorial library up to 735 {\textdegree}C in nitrogen and calculate the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the ternary system using custom-made MATLAB codes. The TEC analysis revealed the potential limitations of Vegard's law in predicting lattice variations for high-entropy materials.

Supported metal in the form of single atoms, clusters, and particles can individually or jointly affect the activity of supported heterogeneous catalysts. While the individual contribution of supported metal to the overall activity of supported photocatalysts has been identified, the joint activity of mixed metal species is overlooked because of their different photoelectric properties. Here, atomically dispersed Pd (Pd1) and Pd clusters are loaded onto CdS, serving as oxidation and reduction sites, respectively, for methanol dehydrogenation. The Pd1 substitutes Cd2+, forming hole-trapping states for methanol oxidation and assisting the dispersion of photo-deposited Pd clusters. Therefore, methanol dehydrogenation on CdS with supported Pd1 and Pd clusters exhibits the highest turnover frequency of 1.14 s-1 based on Pd content, and affords H2 and HCHO with a similar apparent quantum yield of 87 +/- 1% at 452 nm under optimized reaction conditions. This work highlights the synergistic catalysis of supported metal for improved photocatalytic activity.

Epitaxial single-crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films on mica, prepared ex-situ, are explored using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by probing the unoccupied electronic states of their surface in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 80 K. Light-assisted STM measurements under a broadband illumination with visible light were employed to enhance and stabilize surface conductivity. STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3.

- **TL;DR**: 交流电场在特定频率下（约100kHz）能将铁电体开关所需场强降低4-5倍，虽然系统处于过阻尼状态而非共振，但仍显著降低铁电存储器能耗。

Conventionally, dc fields are used for switching dipole orientations in ferroelectrics. Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a "creep" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology.

This study reports on the optical, structural, and dielectric properties of aluminum tantalum oxide (Al$_x$Ta$_y$O$_z$) thin films deposited at low temperature on silicon and steel substrates by pulsed direct current reactive magnetron sputtering of a target containing 80 at.% aluminum and 20 at.% tantalum in Ar/O$_2$ atmosphere. Oxygen flow rates ranging from 5.0 to 20 sccm corresponded to O content changes from 57.7 to 69.6 at.% and resulted in large differences in dielectric behavior, from films with no measurable dielectric strength to a dielectric strength of 231 V$μ$m$^{-1}$, respectively. Ab initio calculations were employed to explain the large property changes, and we show that a decrease in the dielectric strength can be linked to the formation of metal-metal bonds in the material, when the O content is less than what would correspond to a stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_5$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ mixture. The electronic states corresponding to the metal--metal bonds are located in the band gap close to the top of the valence band, leading to an effective band gap reduction, which is directly supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band measurements and by a broad optical absorption in the visible region.

Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications.

Chiral phonons have been identified in several chiral crystals, primarily in those with trigonal symmetry and threefold screw axes. In this study, chiral phonons in CrSi$_2$, a chiral crystal with a sixfold helical structure, were investigated. Circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy revealed a subtle splitting of doubly degenerate $E_2$ phonon modes between cross-circular polarization configurations. These observations, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, indicate the presence of chiral phonons in CrSi$_2$, expanding the scope of materials that exhibit chiral vibrational modes beyond the conventional trigonal class.

Lithium (Li) plating on graphite is a significant degradation mechanism in Li-ion batteries. While numerous experimental techniques have been used to study Li plating in laboratory cells, investigations of commercial high-energy cells often rely on electrochemical methods. Here we present and classify various methods for detecting Li plating on a commercial A123 pouch cell. In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples. This multimodal study demonstrates a range of methods that can be used alone or in combination to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Li-plating.

The stability of chemically complex nanoparticles is governed by an immense configurational space arising from heterogeneous local atomic environments across surface and interior regions. Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.

To advance the understanding of microstructural evolution behavior in Mg-rare earth alloys, the effect of yttrium (Y) addition on static recrystallization and grain growth in Mg alloys was systematically investigated in extruded Mg-1wt.%Y and Mg-7wt.%Y alloys. Y addition was found to significantly retard the microstructural evolution, primarily due to its solute drag effect arising from Y segregation at grain boundaries. The relative intensity of solute drag effects from different alloying elements in Mg alloys was further assessed from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, considering their grain boundary segregation tendencies and diffusivities. Additionally, static recrystallization in Mg-Y alloys was observed to proceed via a two-stage behavior characterized with two distinct JMAK exponents, indicating the heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) behavior was observed in these Mg-Y alloys. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of Y segregation at grain boundaries in controlling recrystallization and grain growth kinetics in Mg-Y alloys. This provides new insights into the design of thermally stable Mg alloys with refined microstructures.

Polymer electrolytes are critical for safe, high-energy-density solid-state batteries, yet discovering candidates that balance high ionic conductivity with high transference numbers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to navigate a chemical space of 1.7 million hypothetical polymer electrolyte candidates. Data from previous literature is used to warm-start batch Bayesian optimization for iteratively selecting new polymer electrolytes to evaluate. We iteratively identified, evaluated and analyzed 767 homopolymers as potential candidates. Our results reveal several candidates with transport properties exceeding the benchmark polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI system. Crucially, our optimization campaigns for ionic conductivity and Li-diffusivity demonstrate that branched architectures and ketone functional groups significantly enhance ion-hopping mechanisms within the polymer matrix. We provide an in-depth mechanistic comparison of Li vs. Na cation transport and offer our open-source framework to accelerate the discovery of liquid, gel, and multi-cation electrolyte systems.

- **TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于第一性原理构建Newns-Anderson哈密顿量的方法，通过投影算符对角化Kohn-Sham DFT哈密顿矩阵，应用于H在Al、Cu、Pt(111)表面的化学吸附，验证了宽频极限近似的适用范围。

The Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian is widely used to describe adsorption at gas-solid interfaces, yet its construction typically relies on simplifying assumptions such as constant coupling and the wideband limit approximation. Here, we present a first-principles approach to construct Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians by applying projection operator diabatisation to Hamiltonian matrices obtained from Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate this method for chemisorbed hydrogen on three fcc metal(111) surfaces: Al, Cu, and Pt. To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations. Analysis of the chemisorption function reveals that the wideband limit approximation is valid for H/Al(111) but has limited applicability for H/Cu(111) and H/Pt(111).
